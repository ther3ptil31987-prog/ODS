# ODS backup path contract
# ============================================================================
# Single source of truth for the user-data directories `ods backup` captures
# and `ods restore` puts back. Sourced by ods-backup.sh and ods-restore.sh so
# the two sides cannot drift apart.
#
# A directory belongs here when a bundled service bind-mounts it under
# ./data/ and its contents are user state that cannot be regenerated:
# conversations, workflows, vectors, agent memory, usage history, device
# authorisations.
#
# Regenerable caches are deliberately excluded (see
# ODS_BACKUP_EXCLUDED_DATA_PATHS below) — they are large, re-downloadable,
# and would dominate every archive.
#
# tests/test-backup-data-coverage.sh fails the build when a bundled service
# mounts a ./data/ directory that appears in neither list.
