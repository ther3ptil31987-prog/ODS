# ODS Extensions

## Two Kinds of Extension

| I want to... | Type | Start here |
|---|---|---|
| Add a Docker service (new container, health check, dashboard tile) | Service extension | This guide (below) |
| Add an app that uses the local LLM | Swap-safe LLM extension | [SWAP-SAFE-EXTENSIONS.md](SWAP-SAFE-EXTENSIONS.md) |
| Change the installer itself (new tier, swap theme, add/skip phase) | Installer mod | [INSTALLER-ARCHITECTURE.md](INSTALLER-ARCHITECTURE.md) |
| Build a custom downstream edition or appliance | Fork / downstream build | [BUILD-ON-ODS-SERVER.md](BUILD-ON-ODS-SERVER.md) |

This guide is the fastest path to extend ODS without editing core internals.

## Installing from the Portal conversation

The catalog contains 200 distinct available extensions. Availability means ODS
has a configuration or activation path; it does not mean the application has
been downloaded, configured or started.

- `/extensions @name` selects an exact catalog extension. The installer checks
  dependencies and required settings, advances one operation at a time, and
  reports readiness separately from acceptance of an installation request.
- `/extensions https://github.com/owner/repository` asks the model to inspect
  that public repository and propose an ODS recipe at an immutable commit.
  This is research only; accepting a proposal does not start installation.
- `/extensions install https://github.com/owner/repository` authorizes the
  managed installation. The model researches and proposes the recipe, and ODS
  prepares and advances that exact accepted proposal, returning actual receipts.
  Free text after a URL does not grant automatic installation authority: it may
  contain conditions or negations. A later installation needs a new explicit
  install command; a saved research request is never silently promoted.
- Required secrets are entered into the configuration form, outside the
  conversation. Saving the missing values resumes the GitHub request without
  asking the model to create a second recipe.

GitHub proposals support validated Compose recipes with pinned image digests
or source builds from the selected GitHub repository at an exact commit.
Source contexts use `https://github.com/OWNER/REPO.git#FULL_COMMIT[:subdir]`;
the upstream Dockerfile is inspected at that revision before preparation.
Build settings accept `context`, `dockerfile` and optional `target`; source
services use `image: ods-source-SERVICE:FULL_COMMIT` and `pull_policy: never`.
Container restrictions still apply. Open-source license evidence is required.
For a project without an upstream Dockerfile, the model can research its build
inputs and propose `dockerfile_inline` instead of `dockerfile` (Compose 2.17+).
Those bytes are part of the recipe digest and have a separate SHA-256 receipt;
ODS does not present them as an upstream file. Inline content is limited to
24 KiB and must escape dollar signs as `$$` to avoid host interpolation.
Custom installation hooks, build secrets/SSH, additional contexts and unknown licenses require further work;
they are not silently executed or represented as installed extensions.
Repository documentation is evidence for the model, never execution authority.

Cancelling or switching conversations stops further automatic advancement. An
operation already accepted by the host may still finish. ODS preserves uncertain
operation records instead of repeating a download or start request after a lost
acknowledgement. Viewing saved conversation history does not start installation.

When a successful current request has an identified Playground project, Portal
continues with a real model turn to apply the requested integration to existing
project files. After a reload, a saved pending integration offers **Continue
integration**: it checks current readiness without replaying installation.
The continuation has a stable request ID so duplicate tabs use the retained
chat request boundary. A dispatched continuation is not a claim that project
code integration succeeded; its model result still needs to be assessed.

For use inside a project, the extension inspection tool exposes documentation
and declared connection fields from the installed recipe first. These defaults
do not prove an endpoint is reachable. The model must inspect the actual project
and runtime before changing application code. A saved project association is
not proof that the application has been integrated or tested.

See [current expansion readiness](EXTENSION-READINESS.md) for implementation and
verification limits.


For an installation where Windows owns the environment file and the WSL manager
uses a private credential projection, the service operator can append
`--credential-source /mnt/<drive>/<installation>/.env` to the manager's `serve`
command. The destination must already be a private `.env` containing only
`DASHBOARD_API_KEY`, inside a directory owned by the service user with mode 0700.
The systemd unit must expose that private directory as a writable bind and the
source as read-only. This path option is not accepted from model tool requests.
Before API-bound operations, the manager refreshes only that key atomically;
invalid, duplicate, symlinked or changing sources cannot replace the valid copy.
The ordinary native environment reader retains its ownership/mode checks.

## Extension Directory Structure

Each extension service is a directory under `extensions/services/`:

```
extensions/services/
  my-service/
    manifest.yaml      # Service metadata (required)
    compose.yaml       # Docker Compose fragment (for extension services)
    compose.amd.yaml   # GPU overlay for AMD (optional)
    compose.nvidia.yaml # GPU overlay for NVIDIA (optional)
```

**Core services** (llama-server, open-webui, dashboard, dashboard-api) have only a `manifest.yaml` — their compose definitions live in `docker-compose.base.yml`.

**Extension services** have both `manifest.yaml` and `compose.yaml`. The compose fragment is merged into the stack automatically by `resolve-compose-stack.sh`.

The current manifest schema is v1. If you are proposing new manifest semantics
rather than filling existing fields, read
[SERVICE_MANIFEST_V2_PLAN.md](SERVICE_MANIFEST_V2_PLAN.md) first. v1 remains
the supported schema until migration tooling and compatibility policy are in
place.

## What You Can Extend

- **Docker services** via `extensions/services/<name>/compose.yaml`
- **Service metadata** (health checks, ports, aliases, categories) via `manifest.yaml`
- **Feature tiles** exposed by `GET /api/features` via manifest `features` blocks
- **Dashboard UI** via plugin registration in `dashboard/src/plugins/registry.js`

## 30-Minute Path: Add a Service

### Step 1: Create the extension directory

```bash
mkdir extensions/services/my-service
cp extensions/templates/service-template.yaml extensions/services/my-service/manifest.yaml
cp extensions/templates/compose-template.yaml extensions/services/my-service/compose.yaml
```

The commented starter files live in [`extensions/templates/`](../extensions/templates/README.md).

### Step 2: Create the manifest

Edit the manifest:
- set `service.id` to a unique kebab-case ID
- set `service.name`, `service.port`, `service.health`
- set `service.aliases` for CLI shorthand names
- set `service.container_name` (typically `ods-<id>`)
- set `service.category`: `core`, `recommended`, or `optional`
- set `service.compose_file: compose.yaml`
- set `service.depends_on` if it needs other services
- set `service.gpu_backends` (`amd`, `nvidia`, or both)
- add feature entries under `features` if the service unlocks user-visible capability

### Step 3: Create the compose fragment

Create `extensions/services/my-service/compose.yaml`:

```yaml
services:
  my-service:
    image: my-org/my-service:latest
    container_name: ods-my-service
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "${MY_SERVICE_PORT:-9200}:8080"
    environment:
      - LLM_URL=http://llama-server:8080/v1
    depends_on:
      llama-server:
        condition: service_healthy
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 15s
```

The service automatically joins `ods-network` and can reach other services by Docker DNS name.

### Step 4: Validate

```bash
# Schema check
python3 -c "import yaml; yaml.safe_load(open('extensions/services/my-service/manifest.yaml'))"

# Compose merge check
docker compose -f docker-compose.base.yml -f docker-compose.amd.yml \
  -f extensions/services/my-service/compose.yaml config

# Contract audit (manifest + compose + overlay consistency)
python3 scripts/audit-extensions.py --project-dir .
bash tests/test-extension-audit.sh

# Integration/smoke checks
bash tests/integration-test.sh
bash tests/smoke/linux-amd.sh
```

### Step 5: Test it

```bash
# Enable and start
ods enable my-service
ods start my-service

# Verify healthy
ods logs my-service
curl http://localhost:9200/health

# Check it appears in the list
ods list
```

## Enable/Disable Mechanism

- `compose.yaml` present → **enabled** (included in stack)
- `compose.yaml.disabled` → **disabled** (manifest still visible to CLI/dashboard)
- Core services (`category: core`) have no compose.yaml — always on in base.yml

```bash
ods enable my-service    # Renames compose.yaml.disabled → compose.yaml
ods disable my-service   # Stops container, renames compose.yaml → compose.yaml.disabled
ods list                 # Shows all services with status
```

## Portal Updates and Rollback

Extensions installed from the bundled library receive a content receipt. The
Dashboard Extensions page compares that receipt with both the current library
definition and the installed definition:

- `current`: installed files still match the receipt and the library
- `available`: ODS ships a newer library definition
- `modified`: installed definition files changed locally after installation
- `untracked`: legacy install created before content receipts were introduced

An update is staged and security-scanned on the same filesystem before the
installed directory is atomically replaced. Enabled services are reconciled
through the host agent; disabled and one-shot CLI extensions remain disabled.
Existing service configuration is preserved, while new default config files
may be added when they do not already exist. Those newly added defaults are
also preserved if the definition is rolled back.

Local definition changes are never overwritten without an explicit
confirmation. The previous definition is retained as a single rollback backup,
and the portal exposes **Rollback** after a successful update. Update and
rollback replace extension definitions only: service data, Docker volumes,
secrets, and existing configuration remain in place.

## Audit Extensions Before You Ship

ODS now includes an extension audit workflow so new services can be
validated like core components instead of relying on ad hoc manual checks.

Run the full audit:

```bash
python3 scripts/audit-extensions.py --project-dir .
```

Audit one service only:

```bash
python3 scripts/audit-extensions.py --project-dir . whisper
```

Fail on warnings too:

```bash
python3 scripts/audit-extensions.py --project-dir . --strict
```

From an installed system you can use the CLI:

```bash
ods audit
ods audit --json comfyui
```

What the audit checks:
- manifest schema/version, categories, types, ports, and health endpoints
- alias collisions and broken dependency references
- feature IDs and feature service references
- compose file presence for non-core docker services
- compose container names, port mappings, healthchecks, and disabled-state discovery
- GPU overlay coverage for stub-based GPU services such as ComfyUI-style layouts

This is especially useful when validating large extension libraries, because it
surfaces integration regressions before they hit installer or runtime testing.

## Manifest Contract (v1)

Required root field:
- `schema_version: ods.services.v1`

Optional root field:
- `compatibility` — version compatibility hints:
  - `ods_min`: minimum ODS version this extension supports (e.g. `"2.0.0"`)
  - `ods_max`: maximum ODS version this extension was tested against (optional)

Service section:
- required: `id`, `name`, `port`, `health`
- recommended: `aliases`, `container_name`, `compose_file`, `category`, `depends_on`
- optional: `host_env`, `default_host`, `external_port_env`, `external_port_default`, `type`, `gpu_backends`, `env_vars`

Feature section (optional list):
- required per feature: `id`, `name`, `description`, `icon`, `category`, `requirements`, `priority`
- optional: `enabled_services_all`, `enabled_services_any`, `setup_time`, `gpu_backends`

LLM section (optional under `service`, required for LLM consumers):
- `llm.consumes`: `true` when the service sends prompts or completions to a language model
- `llm.route`: `gateway` for `http://litellm:4000/v1` with model `ods/current`, or `direct` for app-specific runtime coupling
- `llm.pinning`: `none` when no concrete model id is stored, or `dynamic` when the app has a refresh/reconcile path after swaps
- `llm.min_context`: optional context floor used for visible model gates
- `llm.probe`: harness probe descriptor with `kind`, `path`, and `auth`

For the extension-author workflow and examples, see
[SWAP-SAFE-EXTENSIONS.md](SWAP-SAFE-EXTENSIONS.md). Apps that speak the
OpenAI protocol should use the gateway alias by default and avoid persisting
GGUF filenames, catalog ids, or other concrete model names.

## Service Categories

| Category | Behavior | Examples |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `core` | Always on, lives in base.yml | llama-server, open-webui, dashboard |
| `recommended` | Enabled by default | searxng, litellm, token-spy |
| `optional` | User opts in | n8n, whisper, tts, comfyui |

## GPU Overlay Patterns

If your service uses a GPU, you need overlay files alongside `compose.yaml`. The compose resolver (`resolve-compose-stack.sh`) automatically picks up `compose.nvidia.yaml` or `compose.amd.yaml` based on the detected GPU vendor. Only one overlay is active at a time.

There are two patterns. Pick the one that matches your service:

### Pattern 1: CPU-Base with GPU Tag Swap

**When to use:** Your service works on CPU but runs faster on GPU (e.g., speech-to-text, embedding generation, transcription).

The base `compose.yaml` has the full service definition with a CPU image. The GPU overlay only overrides the image tag and adds GPU device reservations. Everything else (ports, volumes, healthcheck) is inherited from the base.

**File layout:**
```
extensions/services/my-service/
  manifest.yaml
  compose.yaml            # Full definition, CPU image (e.g., :latest-cpu)
  compose.nvidia.yaml     # Swaps image to :latest-cuda, adds GPU devices
  compose.amd.yaml        # Swaps image to :latest-rocm, adds AMD devices
```

**Example** (from whisper):

`compose.yaml` — full service with CPU image:
```yaml
services:
  whisper:
    image: ghcr.io/speaches-ai/speaches:latest-cpu
    container_name: ods-whisper
    # ... ports, volumes, healthcheck, etc.
```

`compose.nvidia.yaml` — only the GPU-specific overrides:
```yaml
services:
  whisper:
    image: ghcr.io/speaches-ai/speaches:latest-cuda
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 1
              capabilities: [gpu]
        limits:
          cpus: '4.0'
          memory: 8G
```

### Pattern 2: Empty Base with Full GPU Overlay

**When to use:** Your service only makes sense on a GPU, with no CPU fallback (e.g., image generation, video rendering).

The base `compose.yaml` is an empty stub (`services: {}`). Each GPU overlay contains the complete service definition. The definitions often differ significantly between vendors (different images, device passthrough, environment variables, CLI flags).

**File layout:**
```
extensions/services/my-service/
  manifest.yaml
  compose.yaml            # Empty stub: services: {}
  compose.nvidia.yaml     # Complete NVIDIA definition
  compose.amd.yaml        # Complete AMD definition
```

**Example** (from comfyui):

`compose.yaml` — empty stub so the registry detects the service:
```yaml
# ComfyUI — Image Generation
# The GPU overlay provides the full service definition.
services: {}
```

`compose.nvidia.yaml` — full service definition:
```yaml
services:
  comfyui:
    build:
      context: ./comfyui
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    container_name: ods-comfyui
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "${COMFYUI_PORT:-8188}:8188"
    volumes:
      - ./data/comfyui/models:/models
      # ... other mounts
    shm_size: '8g'
    deploy:
      resources:
        reservations:
          devices:
            - driver: nvidia
              count: 1
              capabilities: [gpu]
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "--spider", "--quiet", "http://localhost:8188"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      start_period: 120s
      retries: 3
```

`compose.amd.yaml` — full service with AMD-specific config:
```yaml
services:
  comfyui:
    image: ignatberesnev/comfyui-gfx1151:v0.2
    container_name: ods-comfyui
    devices:
      - /dev/dri:/dev/dri
      - /dev/kfd:/dev/kfd
    group_add:
      - "${VIDEO_GID:-44}"
      - "${RENDER_GID:-992}"
    environment:
      - MIOPEN_FIND_MODE=FAST
      - TORCH_ROCM_AOTRITON_ENABLE_EXPERIMENTAL=1
    volumes:
      - ./data/comfyui/ComfyUI:/opt/ComfyUI:z
      - ./data/comfyui/miopen:/root/.config/miopen:z
    # ... ports, volumes, healthcheck, deploy, etc.
```

### GPU Overlay Quick Reference

| | Pattern 1 (tag swap) | Pattern 2 (GPU-only) |
|---|---|---|
| CPU fallback? | Yes | No |
| Base compose.yaml | Full service definition | `services: {}` |
| GPU overlay contains | Image tag + deploy block | Entire service definition |
| Example service | whisper | comfyui |
| Template | `extensions/templates/compose-gpu-swap.yaml` | `extensions/templates/compose-gpu-only.yaml` |

### AMD-Specific Notes

AMD ROCm requires additional container configuration compared to NVIDIA:
- **Device passthrough:** `/dev/dri` (rendering) and `/dev/kfd` (compute)
- **Group membership:** Container user must be in the host's `video` and `render` groups
- **GFX version override:** Avoid setting `HSA_OVERRIDE_GFX_VERSION` unless a specific image requires emulation. A wrong value can dispatch incompatible kernels; an empty value is also invalid. Prefer an image that contains kernels for the native `rocminfo` architecture.
- **Security relaxation:** `cap_add: SYS_PTRACE` and `seccomp:unconfined` may be needed for ROCm profiling. They are refused in user and library extensions (see the compose policy below); a curated recipe's `compose.amd.yaml` may add only `/dev/kfd`, `/dev/dri` and the `${VIDEO_GID:-44}` / `${RENDER_GID:-992}` groups

## Compatibility Checklist

- Service ID is unique and stable
- Health endpoint is cheap and deterministic
- LLM-consuming services declare `service.llm` or use the documented gateway
  default from [SWAP-SAFE-EXTENSIONS.md](SWAP-SAFE-EXTENSIONS.md)
- Feature requirements use real service IDs
- AMD/NVIDIA support is explicitly declared
- Docs/examples reference canonical paths (`config/n8n`, `docker compose`)
- CI scripts pass locally (`integration-test`, smoke scripts, syntax checks)

## Testing Checklist (PR Gate)

- `bash -n` on changed shell files
- `python3 -m py_compile extensions/services/dashboard-api/main.py`
- `bash tests/integration-test.sh`
- relevant smoke scripts in `tests/smoke/`
- if dashboard code changed and Node is available:
```bash
cd extensions/services/dashboard
npm install
npm run lint
npm run build
```

## Runtime Lifecycle

This section describes the end-to-end flow of how extensions are discovered, installed, enabled, and managed at runtime. Each step references the source file that implements it.

### 1. Catalog Generation

At startup, the Dashboard API (`config.py:load_extension_catalog()`) loads `config/extensions-catalog.json` — a static JSON file listing all available extensions. This catalog is served via `GET /api/extensions/catalog` and enriched at request time with live status (enabled, disabled, not_installed, incompatible) by checking the filesystem and service health (`routers/extensions.py:_compute_extension_status()`).

### 2. Manifest Loading

The Dashboard API loads manifests from `extensions/services/*/manifest.yaml` at startup (`config.py:load_extension_manifests()`). This populates the `SERVICES` dict (used for health checks) and `FEATURES` list (used by the features endpoint). Disabled extensions (those with `compose.yaml.disabled` instead of `compose.yaml`) are skipped during manifest loading — they do not appear in service health checks or feature recommendations.

### 3. Install (Library to User Extensions)

When a user installs an extension via the dashboard (`POST /api/extensions/{service_id}/install`), the extensions router:

1. Validates the service ID and confirms it is not a core service
2. Locates the extension in the **extensions library** (`$ODS_DATA_DIR/extensions-library/<id>/`)
3. Performs a size check (max 50 MB) and security scan of every compose file the recipe ships (the shared compose policy below)
4. Copies the extension to `$ODS_DATA_DIR/user-extensions/<id>/` atomically via a temp directory on the same filesystem
5. Calls the host agent to start the container (`POST /v1/extension/start`)

The install uses file locking (`fcntl.flock`) to prevent double-install races.

#### Compose policy

`dashboard-api` (`routers/extensions.py:_scan_compose_content`, at install and
enable time) and `scripts/resolve-compose-stack.sh`
(`_scan_user_compose_content`, on every `ods` command) run one rule set: the
`# >>> shared compose policy >>>` block, kept byte-identical in both files
(`extensions/services/dashboard-api/tests/test_compose_policy_parity.py`). Values are judged the way Docker
Compose resolves them, and anything the file alone cannot decide is refused:

- **Parsing:** one YAML document, no duplicate keys, no Compose `!reset` /
  `!override` tags, no self-referencing anchors.
- **Booleans:** `privileged` and `use_api_socket` must be absent or an explicit
  false; Compose casts the strings `true`/`yes`/`y`/`on` to true.
- **Interpolation:** a guarded value may not use `${VAR}` / `$VAR` (Compose
  fills it from the owner's environment or the default). The exceptions are
  the shapes ODS core uses: the `${VIDEO_GID:-44}` / `${RENDER_GID:-992}` GPU
  groups, `${ODS_UID:-N}:${ODS_GID:-N}` users, `${VAR:-127.0.0.1}` port hosts
  and NVIDIA `device_ids`.
- **Other files and containers:** no top-level `include`, `name`, `secrets`,
  `configs` or `models`; no service `extends`, `env_file`, `label_file`,
  `volumes_from`, `secrets`, `configs`, `post_start`/`pre_stop` hooks,
  `develop`, `provider`, `annotations`, `cgroup_parent` or
  `device_cgroup_rules`.
- **Namespaces:** no `host` network/PID/IPC/UTS/user/cgroup namespace, and no
  `container:` or `service:` join outside the extension's own file.
- **Capabilities and security options:** `cap_add` only from Docker's default
  set (never `SYS_ADMIN`, `DAC_READ_SEARCH`, `NET_ADMIN`, ...; `CAP_` prefix and
  case are normalised); `security_opt` only `no-new-privileges`.
- **Users and groups:** no root user (`root`, `0`, `00`, `+0`); `group_add`
  only the GPU groups, only in a curated recipe's `compose.amd.yaml`.
- **Volumes:** no absolute, `~`, Windows or `..` host paths, no Docker socket or
  named pipe. Relative binds resolve against the ODS install directory (the
  first `-f` file), so `.`, `./.env` and the whole `./data` / `./config` are
  refused, and an imported (GitHub) recipe may bind only its own
  `./data/<id>` and `./config/<id>`. Named volumes and networks may not set a
  driver, options, `name` or `external` other than joining `ods-network`;
  services may not set per-network aliases or addresses.
- **Provenance:** a library recipe is curated unless its `upstream.json`
  records `origin: github-proposal`. A linked, oversized (over 512 KiB),
  non-JSON or duplicate-key marker is never curated: staging refuses the
  install and the resolver treats the recipe as imported.
- **Refusals do not take the stack down:** the resolver leaves a refused
  file out with a `WARNING`. Compose rejects the whole project when a service
  depends on an undefined one, so the resolver also leaves out every user
  extension that needs (`depends_on`, `links`, `service:` namespaces) a
  service no remaining file declares, transitively, naming the chain back to
  the refusal. `ods enable`, `ods disable` and `ods mode` print these
  warnings. The dashboard's enable/activate re-scan applies the same
  imported-recipe bind namespace as the install gate.

### 4. Enable / Disable

Extensions are enabled or disabled by renaming their compose file:

- **Enable** (`POST /api/extensions/{service_id}/enable`): Renames `compose.yaml.disabled` to `compose.yaml`, then calls the host agent to start the container. Before enabling, the router checks that all dependencies declared in the manifest's `service.depends_on` are present and enabled.
- **Disable** (`POST /api/extensions/{service_id}/disable`): Calls the host agent to stop the container first (prevents zombie containers), then renames `compose.yaml` to `compose.yaml.disabled`. Warns if other enabled extensions depend on this one.

Both operations validate that the compose file is not a symlink (TOCTOU prevention under lock) and re-scan compose contents before enabling.

### 5. Host Agent Container Management

The [host agent](HOST-AGENT-API.md) (`bin/ods-host-agent.py`) runs on the host machine and exposes `/v1/extension/start`, `/v1/extension/stop`, and `/v1/extension/logs`. When the Dashboard API calls start/stop, the host agent:

1. Resolves the full compose stack by calling `scripts/resolve-compose-stack.sh`
2. Runs `docker compose <flags> up -d <service_id>` (start) or `docker compose <flags> stop <service_id>` (stop)
3. For start operations, pre-creates any `./data/` volume directories with correct ownership

If the host agent is unreachable, file-level operations (install, enable, disable) still succeed, but `restart_required: true` is returned to signal that `ods restart` is needed.

### 6. Compose Stack Discovery

`scripts/resolve-compose-stack.sh` dynamically builds the list of `-f` flags for `docker compose`. It:

1. Selects the base compose files based on GPU backend and tier (e.g., `docker-compose.base.yml` + `docker-compose.nvidia.yml`)
2. Walks `extensions/services/*/` and includes each extension's `compose.yaml` if it exists (not `.disabled`), skipping extensions incompatible with the current GPU backend
3. Picks up GPU-specific overlays (`compose.<backend>.yaml`) and mode-specific overlays (`compose.local.yaml`) per extension
4. Walks `data/user-extensions/*/` and includes compose files from user-installed extensions
5. Appends `docker-compose.override.yml` if it exists (user customizations)

### 7. Uninstall

Uninstalling (`DELETE /api/extensions/{service_id}`) requires the extension to be disabled first (compose file must be renamed to `.disabled`). It then removes the extension directory from `user-extensions/` under file lock.

One state is handled by the endpoint itself: an extension whose last install or start attempt failed (status `error`) still has an enabled `compose.yaml`, so the uninstall performs the disable step first. The host agent must stop the service before the definition is touched (a failed stop returns 502 and nothing is removed), and removal is refused with 409 while any enabled extension depends on it. Running, stopped, starting and unhealthy extensions still return 400 until they are disabled explicitly. Uninstall never deletes service data; purging stays a separate, confirmed request (`DELETE /api/extensions/{service_id}/data`).

### 8. Dashboard UI Status Polling

The dashboard frontend polls `GET /api/extensions/catalog` to display extension status. Each extension's status is computed by checking:

- For core/built-in services: whether the service health check reports "healthy"
- For user-installed extensions: whether `compose.yaml` (enabled) or `compose.yaml.disabled` (disabled) exists in the user-extensions directory
- For extensions not yet installed: whether the current GPU backend is compatible

The catalog response also includes `agent_available` (whether the host agent is reachable) and `library_available` (whether the extensions library directory exists and is non-empty).

## Notes

- Manifest loading is additive with safe fallback defaults.
- Unknown/malformed manifests are skipped with warnings, not fatal crashes.
- Keep extension files ASCII and small; one service per directory is preferred.
- The service registry (`lib/service-registry.sh`) provides bash functions for resolving aliases and discovering enabled services.
- **Scripts that load `.env`:** Source `lib/safe-env.sh` and use `load_env_file "<path>"`; do not use `eval` or `export $(grep ... .env | xargs)` (injection risk).
