# ODS v3 audit remediation — 2026-09-28

This is the implementation ledger for the eight findings in the audit of
`v3.0.0` (`bec0c42e7c9885a5aecd419a166a6a81e0d37236`). Changes target current
`main`; findings about the historical tag are not automatically findings about
current main. In particular, remote Dashboard session authentication was already
implemented on main before this work.

**Status: runtime security implementation and automated validation are available
for review; release provenance is not operationally closed. The public installer
channel is preserved, so merging the runtime fixes does not require activating
an unqualified signed release.**

### Rollout separation

The verified commands are now staged in
[Verified Installer Preview](VERIFIED_INSTALL_PREVIEW.md), with the unchanged
verification boundary and executable tests. The main README keeps the existing
development-main installation path and states its unsigned-source limitation.
This is not a fallback from failed verification: the preview still refuses an
ineligible release without running any installer.

Recommended review order is producer-only #6882, then security #6859 after
refreshing its base and confirming CI. The implementation team owns testing;
Mike owns the requested merges. Real signing/publication needs separate release
authorization, and qualification of those real artifacts precedes a separate
public-channel activation change. This removes the release-publication blocker
from the runtime fixes, but **does not close SEC-005's default-channel finding**.

The separated preview passed all 12 consumer contracts on Windows PowerShell
5.1 and all 12 on Linux locally, including real archive extraction with fixture
installers and rejection before mutation. Linux used the Ubuntu unzip package
extracted into the test user's cache, without changing the live ODS or installing
a system package. Documentation checks found no new broken links; the existing
103-link baseline remains. CI must confirm this follow-up before review status
changes; the earlier 80 passed checks describe the preceding implementation.

### Current evidence (supersedes earlier pending CI notes below)

At commit `da9e2198b0ae4906be5ccbf79fa706fa3d811be4`,
[runtime security run 36482083471](https://github.com/Osmantic/ODS/actions/runs/36482083471)
passed all 15 jobs. These include the nine real production Dockerfile builds,
locked dependency audits, real-container source confinement/recovery/library
build tests, private-port and workflow policies, and saved-stack/verified
consumer checks on Windows, Linux and macOS. Native macOS migration cases use
controlled Docker/launchd fixtures, even when run on a macOS runner.

The same commit's [Dashboard run 36482083683](https://github.com/Osmantic/ODS/actions/runs/36482083683)
passed the complete API job and frontend jobs on Windows, Linux and macOS.
The broad integration job then exposed an incomplete bootstrap rollback test
installation: it omitted the now-required `compose-cache-policy.py`, so the
operation correctly stopped before reaching the rollback scenario. The
rollback, recovered-flags and Windows native-model fixtures now include the
actual policy helper; all three pass locally without bypassing the gate.
The complete installer contract script also passes against an isolated Git
archive with those three fixture changes applied. This uses committed source
line endings; running the same grep-based contracts directly against a Windows
checkout with CRLF template files produces an unrelated end-of-line mismatch.
The follow-up changes test fixtures and this ledger, not production behavior;
the broad integration workflow must confirm the corrected fixture.

Producer-only PR #6882 at `ebef61fa848aba44bb72b0f90982e28b75a57eca`
passed [run 36482081414](https://github.com/Osmantic/ODS/actions/runs/36482081414)
on all three operating systems. Its 13 tests include packaging the complete
committed repository with its actual `.gitattributes`; API signature responses
remain fixtures and do not establish real OIDC signing.

The public latest-release API was checked again: `v3.0.0` has `immutable: false`
and no release assets. It is not eligible for the new consumer. First-release
publication and end-to-end verification therefore remain required, regardless
of the passing source-contract CI. No tag, release or running installation was
modified. The later chronological notes retain earlier failures and their
resolutions; they are not a claim that those resolved failures remain open.

| Finding | Implemented in this branch | Remaining verification/work |
| --- | --- | --- |
| SEC-001: LAN exposure | Private Compose ports and native inference stay loopback-bound; authenticated UI entrypoints retain LAN access; Hermes LAN proxy requires an owner session; new recipes cannot interpolate host binds. | Automated port, route, upgrade and migration coverage passed. Physical full-install/GPU coverage is not claimed. |
| SEC-002: Python advisories | Upgrade FastAPI/Starlette and aiohttp; all nine API/relay Docker builds install complete hash-checked locks; production audits are clean. All nine production Dockerfile builds and in-container pip checks passed CI on `1788236a9`. | Keep final-head dependency and regression checks green. |
| SEC-003: source containment | Generated source services have numeric non-root UID, no capabilities, no-new-privileges, read-only root, resource limits and an internal network; API publication/re-enable and dynamic resolver enforce the profile. Saved stack arguments are revalidated by the host and platform CLIs, including old receipts; merged recipes cannot override or join source sandboxes. | Real-container and cross-platform saved-stack CI passed. Existing recipes requiring broader permissions need explicit review, not silent migration. |
| SEC-004: public AI spending | Paid issue triage and review comments require a trusted association; serialized jobs and per-run budgets; unauthorized comments cannot cancel another comment's review. | Workflow contracts passed. This bounds individual runs, not the organization's total monthly provider bill. |
| SEC-005: provenance | Python locks/hashes and pinned core/library images; local library images require a forced in-recipe build. Signed-tag source packaging, draft-only checksum/SBOM/OIDC workflow, and Windows/POSIX verified consumers are implemented. The verified public-channel change is staged separately from the current main quickstart. | Library and producer CI passed. Verify the first signed immutable candidate end to end, then activate the verified public channel in a separate reviewed change. The default-channel finding remains open. Existing tags have not been changed or retroactively signed. |
| SEC-006: React Router | Coordinated update to react-router-dom 7.18.4 and its lockfile; production npm audit is clean. | Focused malicious-navigation cases and full frontend jobs on all three hosts passed on the implementation commit above. |
| SEC-007: local origin trust | State-changing requests require exact Origin/Host agreement; the CORS allowlist no longer grants mutation authority. | Focused authentication/origin cases and the full API job passed on the implementation commit above. |
| SEC-008: mutable Actions | Remaining twelve Action uses pinned to full commit hashes. | Workflow contracts passed. |

## Validation evidence

- Nine Python production locks: `pip-audit --require-hashes` reports no known
  vulnerabilities for each; the Dashboard lock also installed successfully in
  a clean Linux virtual environment.
- Dashboard frontend: 210 files / 1,773 tests passed; build and lint passed
  (lint retained pre-existing warnings). Production npm audit: zero findings.
  Development-tool advisories are not included in that production-only result.
- Eight additional navigation cases now cover malicious query destinations,
  protocol-relative/encoded/script URLs, redirect history replacement and
  external tab isolation. Forty focused App/Sidebar/registry/settings tests
  passed. The new cases exercise existing production behavior with the upgraded
  router; they do not introduce new navigation behavior. ESLint reports zero
  errors and the existing JSX unused-variable warning pattern.
- API authentication/origin tests: 35 passed.
- Focused recipe/API suite on Linux: 679 passed, two skipped. A subsequent
  policy/source run passed 272, with 134 platform-gated skips. Windows policy
  tests passed 713; one Bash integration case failed because Windows selected
  the WSL launcher in a restricted test environment. That integration case
  passed in the Linux run.
- Native model launch and Lemonade tests on Windows: 142 passed. The LAN bind
  test covers Windows, Linux and Darwin branches using mocked process launch;
  this is not a physical macOS/GPU validation.
- macOS bridge shell contracts passed, including loopback inference and bridge
  restoration with IPv4/IPv6 LAN settings. Network exposure contracts passed
  15 cases; the private-port sweep covers core and community Compose files.
- Source recipe compiler: eight tests passed. Pixel edge: 155 passed; model
  relay: nine passed with the upgraded aiohttp.
- The earlier full Linux API run passed 5,953, skipped 138, failed nine.
  A library-staging race while files were being edited passed on rerun.
  Darwin metrics and WSL-to-Windows PowerShell fixtures still require baseline
  comparison/triage. Do not label the full suite green.
- Runtime security CI run `36463490433` passed on commit `1a9e126fce`:
  all nine locked Python environments installed and passed dependency checks
  and audits, frontend production audit and policy checks passed, and the
  source sandbox passed with real Docker containers and a canary service.
  Docker Desktop remained stopped locally; the live ODS stack was not used.
- Saved-stack policy and model-store integration: 39 tests passed on Linux,
  including actual shell entrypoints and dynamic resolution. Windows PowerShell
  5.1 passed the native saved-stack/model-store integration. Host-agent Compose
  tests: ten passed. Symlink aliases, changed receipts, unsafe overlays and
  cross-extension network attachment are rejected without rewriting approvals.
- The full API CI on the first PR commit passed 6,116 tests and failed two
  assertions still expecting native inference to follow the UI bind address.
  Both expectations now require private loopback and all three related cases
  pass locally. A smoke assertion expecting interpolated OpenClaw ports was
  updated to require literal loopback; its six contracts passed. Await new CI
  before claiming the entire suite passed.
- Image pin update: dependency inventory check and ten dependency contracts
  passed; Whisper CPU/CUDA selection passed 13 cases and Dashboard ownership
  contracts passed. Pins use each tag's top-level descriptor, preserving the
  platform set instead of selecting only an amd64 child manifest.
- Earlier registry checks encountered Docker Hub rate limits and an unavailable
  generic InvokeAI tag. The follow-up resolved the frontend/base images and
  verified all three upstream InvokeAI variants: CPU, CUDA and ROCm. The
  earlier inventory did not include the ROCm tag; it exists and is now pinned.

- A later registry pass resolved 18 more tag descriptors, including references
  duplicated in disabled Langfuse fragments. Those defaults now carry their
  top-level digest, including Node, nginx, CUDA/ROCm, Lemonade, Qdrant, Tailscale,
  Aider and the Dockerfile frontend. Installer prefetch and backend metadata use
  the same references. This preserves each image's existing platform set; it
  does not assert GPU compatibility beyond the upstream image.
- The core dependency checker now rejects any external image without a full
  sha256 digest, including malformed hashes and allowlisted mutable tags.
  Twelve dependency contracts passed. Linux AMD contracts passed; the Windows
  run exposed two stale mocks (JSON is now UTF-8 bytes and launch prefers
  installed PowerShell 7), which were corrected to match existing production
  behavior. All 65 AMD contracts then passed in native Windows/Git Bash.
- Runtime security run `36471971155` on `d7aea8ae9` passed all nine locked
  environments/audits, real-container confinement and saved-stack/verified
  bootstrap tests on Windows, Linux and macOS. Full API and frontend Windows/
  macOS jobs passed too. The Ubuntu frontend failed an unsaved-name test that
  passed locally. Subsequent commit `1788236a9` passed every executed PR check,
  including all three frontend hosts and the full API suite. Runtime security
  run `36473239829` also passed the nine actual production Dockerfile builds
  and in-container dependency checks. This supersedes the earlier pending CI.

The image reader now handles Dockerfile heredocs, logical continuations,
global build arguments, local stages and frontend syntax directives. Python
`from` statements inside the AudioCraft heredoc are no longer mistaken for
registry images. Seventeen dependency contracts pass, including malformed input
rejection and the library boundary. The current library inventory contains 357
references: 253 external references with complete digests and 104 local-build
references across 102 recipes. Local tags require `pull_policy: build` and a
Dockerfile confined to the recipe; a matching `ods/` name alone is insufficient.
This prevents normal Compose startup from trusting a pre-existing/pulled tag
instead of rebuilding the reviewed source. Build cache remains available.

InvokeAI's CPU/CUDA/ROCm indexes were verified anonymously with `docker buildx
imagetools inspect`. Each currently publishes Linux amd64, not native Metal or
arm64. Actual Compose rendering selects the expected backend, private port and
`/api/v1/app/version` readiness URL. The AMD entrypoint receives the render GID.
These checks do not claim physical GPU execution or image-generation success.

The Dify and Jan placeholders were already excluded from the deployable catalog
and refused by the install API. Their unverified disabled Compose templates are
removed; reference documentation explains the unsupported integration and links
to upstream. No installed data is deleted and the generated catalog still has
200 entries. Dify is not being claimed as a newly working integration.

Locally, 338 library staging/resolver cases, 17 dependency contracts, three
actual Compose backend renders and two retired-entry rejection tests passed.
A new disposable Docker CI test seeds an unreviewed local tag and verifies the
shipped pull policy rebuilds the reviewed source. Runtime security run
`36477433876` on `b983b1268` passed all jobs: 22 recovery cases and four library
cases, including the actual forced-build container test, all nine production
image builds and saved-stack checks on Windows, Linux and macOS.
Runtime security run `36476143179` on `4471122f9` passed all jobs, including the
UTF-8 recovery correction; this precedes the library update.

These results refer to the relevant focused changes, not to every combination
of installer, GPU and operating system. The PR remains draft until the remaining
items above and CI are resolved.

### Regression review following installer concerns

The `install-macos.sh` loopback change is intentional, not a claim of unchanged
network behavior: native OpenCode connects to the host's published LiteLLM port
or native llama port. Both listeners remain private even when the UI is exposed
to the LAN. The Colima bridge is a separate container-to-host route.

An additional 30 cases execute the actual installer route-selection block and
config writer for switchboard, cloud and native modes, five IPv4/IPv6 UI bind
settings, and default/custom ports. Custom-port cases make an actual loopback
HTTP request using the generated URL, key and model; upgrade fixtures verify
that unrelated user settings survive. These are fixture endpoints, not model
inference, launchd or a full macOS installation. The test also runs on macOS CI.

The latest completed checks on the preceding commit exposed a PowerShell 5.1
UTF-8 BOM handling error, a Linux-only shell fixture running under macOS Bash
3.2, and an outdated SearXNG locale image-reference comment. The remediation
accepts one optional UTF-8 BOM while rejecting invalid/oversized input, selects
Bash 4+ only for the Linux fixture, and aligns the comment with the pinned image.
Native macOS shell cases continue to run with the system Bash. Final-head CI
must confirm these changes before any merge recommendation.

The subsequent Windows CI confirmed both native checks passed, but propagated
the deliberately failing helper's exit code from the rejection test. The test
now exits successfully only after all assertions and cleanup complete. The
integration run reached the macOS CLI suite and found older expectations for
LAN-bound model traffic; these now require loopback while preserving custom
ports and cloud credentials, consistent with the new listener policy.

Release producer contracts pass on Windows and Linux (12 cases each), covering
signature-response rejection, moved tags, unmerged commits, source-only
packaging, reproducibility and symlink refusal. GitHub is the actual signature
verifier; mocked API responses exercise the gate but do not prove production
OIDC signing or published asset verification. No release workflow was dispatched.

Verified consumer contracts exercise the actual PowerShell 5.1/POSIX command
bodies, real archive extraction and fixture installer execution. They constrain
repository, workflow, ref, commit and runner identity before extraction; failed
metadata, tag or attestation checks preserve an existing installation. Paths
include spaces and accented/CJK characters. HTTP and the verifier are controlled
fixtures: real OIDC acceptance remains a first-release gate. Public downloads
avoid GitHub CLI login requirements; only bundle verification invokes `gh`.
The preview bodies are checked against the executable scripts to avoid drift.

Rollout must stage the producer before switching public onboarding to the
verified channel. This draft includes producer and preview for review, but the current
published release is not eligible and no successful new-user installation of
an eligible signed artifact has yet been demonstrated. This gates public-channel
activation, not merging the independently tested runtime fixes. It is not a
reason to add an unsigned fallback to the verified consumer.

Producer-only draft PR #6882 provides the independent prerequisite without
changing the public installer command or runtime. Its initial source contracts
passed on Linux, Windows and macOS in run `36481643159`. A follow-up contract
also packages the full committed repository and checks installer contents using
the committed `.gitattributes` line-ending policy; all 13 producer tests passed
locally on Windows. This proves source packaging compatibility, not acceptance
of a real signed tag or OIDC attestation. Maintainer publication is still needed.

## Upgrade behavior to review

When a legacy recipe fails current Compose validation, stop/disable operations
now have a recovery path that never evaluates that recipe. Docker's existing
container IDs and Compose labels must match the exact installation directory,
base Compose file and requested service. A shared project name such as `ods`
alone does not authorize stopping another installation. Recovery disables the
matched containers' automatic restart, then stops them without deleting data
or containers. Repair and recreate the reviewed recipe before starting again.
Start and restart operations still reject invalid recipes.

Uninstall also checks the saved stack before retiring Pixel/system services or
deleting data, then rechecks immediately before Compose down (which can execute
extension lifecycle hooks). Unsafe recipes and a missing validator fail closed
with instructions to use safe shutdown and review the recipe. Drift after the
initial check stops remaining cleanup and reports that retirement may already
have started. Tests exercise the real uninstaller in temporary directories with
Docker, sudo and service-control substitutes: unsafe input, missing policy,
mid-retirement drift, normal removal and `--keep-data` behavior all pass.
macOS LaunchAgent removal fixtures and 35 system/native retirement cases also
pass. These tests never uninstall the running ODS or start Docker Desktop.

Background model upgrades now revalidate saved Compose fragments before each
service recreation, including retries, Hermes/OpenClaw companions, Lemonade
cleanup and Windows launch-log recovery. An already populated argument array
does not skip validation. The policy CLI accepts explicit argv so spaces and
Unicode are preserved. Missing policy/runtime support stops the operation;
rejected recipes are never passed to Compose or persisted as recovered flags.
Behavioral fixtures execute the production shell functions with real policy
validation and a recording Compose substitute, covering valid confined sources,
legacy unsafe sources and a recipe changed between retry attempts.

This follow-up passed 68 combined saved-stack/model-store cases on Linux and
44 saved-stack cases on Windows (19 POSIX-only skips). Existing hot-swap,
OpenClaw guard, reinstall ownership and model lifecycle lock contracts passed.
`test-cli-bootstrap-compose-wait.sh` still fails because its Docker fixture
does not provide Hermes readiness; the identical failure was reproduced from
the base `main` revision `e3b3c89b4`. This is not evidence of a successful real
model swap. Docker Desktop was not started for these fixtures.

The legacy `upgrade-model.sh` helper also validates before stopping/starting
Compose services and before changing the model in `.env`. Its read-only service
lookup no longer renders Compose merely to return the fixed `llama-server`
name. A refused restart cannot be reported as a successful rollback.

Native macOS activation, rollback preparation, Docker handover and consumer
refresh now use the same saved-recipe policy. Validation happens before
configuration writes and before each Compose command, preserving both original
and resolved paths so symlink aliases cannot erase a recipe's untrusted origin.
The digest-verified rollback snapshot still restores the already-running core
infrastructure without rebuilding a rejected extension.

Validation for this follow-up: 159 saved-stack/legacy-helper/native migration
cases, 66 native finalization cases and 203 native Compose/install/stack cases
passed locally in Linux fixtures.
Existing GPU-overlay selection and atomic `.env` write contracts passed, as did
the configured Ruff rules and workflow security tests. CI now explicitly runs
the migration/activation/finalization fixtures on Linux and macOS. These tests
mock Docker/launchd and do not claim a physical Mac migration or GPU benchmark.

Recovery tests cover Linux/macOS CLI delegation, PowerShell 5.1 stop/disable,
host-agent stop-only recovery, ownership mismatches, malformed Docker metadata,
and preserving recipe files when stopping fails. The dedicated real-container
CI test verifies that another installation with the same project and service
names remains running with its restart policy unchanged. Runtime security CI
`36475219401` on `b6d40a9aa` passed: 21 recovery cases including real containers,
all three saved-stack platform jobs and all nine production image builds.
The local combined cache/recovery run passed 66 cases (one Docker-only skip),
and native PowerShell 5.1 stop/disable passed. Docker Desktop remains stopped
locally. Broader PR checks were still running when this evidence was recorded.
Docker metadata is decoded explicitly as UTF-8 so accented/CJK ownership paths
do not depend on the Windows code page. A real subprocess decoding regression
test forces a legacy default encoding and verifies the path is preserved.

The follow-up lifecycle review also found native background model upgrades still
reading the dashboard's LAN bind, and the macOS doctor probing that address.
Those paths now preserve loopback through model replacement and recovery.
Production argument assembly is tested with LAN/IPv6 settings, custom ports,
model paths containing spaces and GPU/cache options; the Windows restart fixture
and doctor diagnostics also pass. These are controlled runtime fixtures, not
physical Windows GPU or macOS Metal validation.

LAN clients use authenticated UI/gateway routes. Direct inference and extension
ports no longer inherit the UI LAN preference. Applications requiring remote
access need an explicitly configured authenticated proxy or private tunnel.

Older extension recipes with interpolated host binds or without source
confinement must be reviewed again. Approved recipe bytes are not silently
rewritten. Curated recipes can be refreshed from the updated library; custom
recipes must declare literal loopback binds and the required sandbox. A source
application requiring runtime internet access is not silently granted access
to the shared ODS network.

Most changed Compose files contain the same one-line host-binding correction.
Most added dependency lines are generated wheel hashes, not application logic.
