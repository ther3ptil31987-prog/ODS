# Support Bundle

`scripts/ods-support-bundle.sh` creates a redacted diagnostics archive that can
be attached to a GitHub issue or shared with maintainers when install, runtime,
Docker, GPU, or extension behavior is hard to diagnose from screenshots.

## Usage

```bash
# Create artifacts/support/ods-support-<timestamp>.tar.gz
scripts/ods-support-bundle.sh

# Write under a custom directory
scripts/ods-support-bundle.sh --output /tmp/ods-support

# Skip container logs
scripts/ods-support-bundle.sh --no-logs

# Print machine-readable result JSON
scripts/ods-support-bundle.sh --json
```

## What It Collects

- ODS Doctor output, when `scripts/ods-doctor.sh` can run
- Extension audit JSON from `scripts/audit-extensions.py`
- Compose resolution and compose validation output, when Docker Compose is available
- Docker version, daemon info, container summary, and short ODS container log tails
- Platform, git, disk, memory, listening port, manifest, env schema, and redacted `.env` details

Container log tails are limited to names starting with `ods-`, including bundled
sidecars such as `ods-langfuse-postgres`. Other applications whose names merely
contain `ods` are excluded from log collection and do not consume its 25-container
limit. This naming convention is not an ownership or authorization check; custom
containers outside that namespace need separate log collection. The Docker
container summary remains a host-wide diagnostic.

The command is best-effort. Missing Docker, an unreachable daemon, or a failing
diagnostic command is recorded in the bundle instead of aborting the whole run.

## Privacy

The bundle intentionally never includes raw `.env`. It writes
`config/env.redacted` instead.

The redactor masks common secret fields and headers containing words such as
`KEY`, `TOKEN`, `SECRET`, `PASSWORD`, `PASS`, `SALT`, `AUTH`, and `CREDENTIAL`.
It also masks bearer tokens, API-key headers, and credentials embedded in remote
URLs. Credentials with a recognizable format are masked wherever they appear,
even without a key name: provider API keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, Hugging Face,
GitHub, GitLab, Slack, AWS, Google, Stripe and others), JWTs and PEM private-key
blocks. Every secret value in the installation's `.env` that is at least 12
characters long is masked wherever a log or command echoes it.

The bundle directory and archive are created readable only by the user who ran
the script.

Review the archive before posting it publicly. Redaction is defensive, but local
paths, hostnames, container names, model names, and non-secret configuration
values may still be useful to attackers in some environments.

Each collected diagnostic has a 60-second deadline. To allow slower hosts more time,
set `ODS_SUPPORT_COMMAND_TIMEOUT` to an integer from 1 to 3600 seconds. A timed-out
command and its child processes are stopped; the bundle retains partial output and
records exit code 124 in `manifest.json`. Collection continues with other probes.
This is a per-command limit, so the whole bundle can take longer than one deadline.
Docker availability checks also use the limit and report an unavailable daemon on failure.
