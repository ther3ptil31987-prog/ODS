# September 2026 public-beta promotion record

Status: merged into development `main` on 2026-09-24 at 00:47:24 UTC through
[PR #6515](https://github.com/Osmantic/ODS/pull/6515), merge commit
[`1bc5e1cbb24864f1c9efd551e0613202af324e3f`](https://github.com/Osmantic/ODS/commit/1bc5e1cbb24864f1c9efd551e0613202af324e3f).
The final public-beta parent was `99feff29edb453d9bd9db4f99104c7142904aab5`.
The merge does not establish full release qualification or close the missing
acceptance below. This record does not assert a new physical-fleet result.

This record accompanies [promotion PR #6515](https://github.com/Osmantic/ODS/pull/6515).
It describes a move into the development `main` branch, not a stable release,
new version number, or change to `release/2.6.x`. At promotion, the published
stable tag was `v2.6.0`. The subsequent [V3 publication](RELEASE_NOTES_3.0.0.md)
is a separate event; see [Release Channels](RELEASE_CHANNELS.md).

## Candidate and user impact

The initial review compares public-beta
`81fdfc2e3a1536737ae03184e30e5d71ff95ac62` with main
`21f4b3a64dd2a2fac1163f446806091c25b6b814`. Subsequent fixes must be recorded and
the final promoted commit must be bound to its own CI and validation evidence.
Evidence from the initial candidate must not be relabeled as a later-head pass.

The promotion includes the bundled Portal assistant and its Pixel runtime,
dashboard and model-routing changes, expanded native platform handling, and
installer/lifecycle fixes. See [V3 changelog](../CHANGELOG.md#300---2026-09-24).
Native Windows does not install the Portal host runtime; qualifying WSL
installations use the Linux path. Platform eligibility is not a guarantee of
agent task quality.

Merging affects new users: the hosted Linux/macOS quickstart installers follow
`main`, and the native Windows quickstart downloads `main`. A main merge is
therefore an installer-facing change even without a stable tag. Reproducible
deployments should use a pinned release or audited commit.

### Compatibility and recovery changes

- Eligible Linux/WSL and native Apple Silicon macOS installations select Pixel
  by default. Native macOS requires an owner-scoped installation and a local
  Unix Docker socket; a partially installed native deployment requires recovery
  before another installation attempt. Native Windows keeps its separate agent
  path. See [Portal platform eligibility](PIXEL.md#linux-and-wsl2-eligibility).
- The Dashboard source updater and `ods-update.sh` cannot safely coordinate
  native Pixel updates or source-built service rollback. They must refuse those
  installations before pulling source. The separate `ods update` image/runtime
  command is not a source or native Pixel upgrade. Source update also refuses
  ambiguous owner contexts where native identity cannot be established. Root
  callers inspect account-owner receipts, so ordinary root-owned appliances
  retain their backup, restore and configuration rollback paths. These guards
  do not retrofit an older installed updater or
  establish transactional rollback for other source updates.
- Generic ODS backups do not capture the complete native Pixel deployment.
  Full/user-data backup and applying restore must stop on native Pixel state
  until a coordinated capture and recovery contract is implemented. A
  configuration-only archive is not a Pixel backup. Preserve the existing
  installation and recovery receipts; do not delete the source directory or
  manually copy protected state into a replacement deployment. Ambiguous owner
  contexts with unreadable or unsafe ownership receipts are refused too; this does
  not establish that those installations contain Pixel. Old user-data-only
  archives may lack any native selection or exclusion record, so their original
  native coverage cannot be established retroactively.
- Native Windows credential files must have verified current-user-only access
  from creation, before secret bytes are written. Atomic replacement prevents
  existing read handles from observing new credentials. Failure to apply or
  verify permissions, or publish the replacement, stops installation while
  retaining the previous credential file.

These restrictions expose unsupported operations rather than claiming a
successful upgrade or complete backup. Native update and disaster recovery
remain release acceptance gaps. At promotion, the version remained `2.6.0`, so the stable
release checker did not advertise this branch promotion as a version upgrade.
The subsequent [V3 publication](RELEASE_NOTES_3.0.0.md) is a separate
change and does not retroactively qualify this promotion.

## Evidence available

- At the initial candidate, `bash ods/scripts/release-gate.sh` reached
  `[PASS] release gate` on September 23, 2026. It covered source/bundle integrity,
  shell syntax, version and release-claim consistency, generated configuration,
  dependency pins, installer/network contracts, platform smoke simulations,
  and backup/restore rollback contracts. The gate log SHA-256 is
  `c76992bde91320cb1ab19d54a49ef494d21d4607469ae0814b5e927c02c63736`.
- The initial promotion CI exposed Python and shell lint failures that had not
  run on public-beta. PR #6519 resolved them, enabled both gates for public-beta,
  and rebuilt the Pixel source bundle with matching reproducible content.
- Candidate `f91a67ab86d583cc2db45f48fe0d7bc3022f5879` subsequently passed the
  complete source release gate from a clean checkout. Its log SHA-256 is
  `bbc9139863f465d6cff43fe6b201f3310e4ead0afcb3c4178c961576622db70d`.
  The later promotion audit reproduced Windows credential protection,
  quoted Compose path, native backup coverage, and source update limitations.
  Subsequent fixes landed through PRs #6531 and #6535 before promotion.
  Consult PR #6515 for the final-head CI/review record; the earlier gate did not
  cover those defects and is not being relabeled as a final-head pass.
- Prior installed tests span several revisions. They provide useful failure
  evidence but do not establish acceptance of this exact candidate on all six
  target machines.

The source gate uses fixtures and simulations for several platform paths. It
does not prove physical-machine installation, model behavior, or data recovery.

## Known limitations and missing acceptance

The Pixel fleet campaign was capped before any machine completed the full
qualification sequence. It is not being represented as a six-host green run.
Observed task failures included incomplete or malformed coding deliveries,
generated-interface usability problems, unreliable sourced research, and long
task latency. Narrow fixes improve particular failure paths; they do not prove
general agent reliability.

The following remain unqualified for the final promotion candidate:

- The complete [Pixel/Portal acceptance suite](pixel/PORTAL-REGRESSION-ACCEPTANCE.md),
  including follow-up edits, evidence-backed research, error honesty, and
  continuity after restart and update.
- The subsequent general UI and model-switchboard phases. The capped campaign
  did not reach these phases; missing results are not passes.
- Exact-head fresh-install acceptance across the six intended machines, plus
  installed main-to-candidate update, rollback, and reboot continuity with
  retained user data and agent workspaces.

Removing a distracting readiness banner does not change this acceptance state.
Runtime reachability, a successful single conversation, and passing authored
tests each prove less than the complete required user journeys.

## Promotion and recovery requirements

The promotion is merged. Keep the final source identity above and the PR's CI
and review history together; do not retroactively describe earlier-candidate
evidence as a final-head pass. Later release claims still require the missing
acceptance below and any required maintainer approvals.
Apply [Release Validation](RELEASE_VALIDATION.md) and the
[High-Risk Change Map](HIGH_RISK_CHANGE_MAP.md): if a scoped alternative is
accepted, record its exact scope, evidence, and remaining gaps. This document
does not waive those requirements or authorize an administrative bypass.

For an affected installation, retain its previous source identity and backups
of configuration, secrets, persistent volumes, and native agent workspaces
before updating. The generic ODS backup command alone does not satisfy that
requirement for native Pixel. Follow the [Maintainer Runbook](MAINTAINER_RUNBOOK.md#rollback-procedure)
and platform-specific recovery documentation. Reverting a Git merge alone
does not restore runtime data, downloaded artifacts, or native host state.
Installed rollback remains an acceptance item, not a guarantee supplied by
the source-level rollback fixture.
