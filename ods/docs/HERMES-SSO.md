# Hermes access and optional owner-card SSO

Current ODS installs use Hermes 0.21.5's required dashboard authentication. The dashboard's Hermes link opens `/auth/ods` through `hermes-proxy` on port 9120, validates the existing ODS session, and signs into Hermes with server-held managed credentials. Only allowlisted HttpOnly cookies are returned, without a Domain attribute, and the destination is always `/` on the same origin. Direct visits can use Hermes's native login for operator-configured credentials. See [the current auth contract](HERMES.md#security-posture).

Operators who want the additional owner-card gate can set `HERMES_REQUIRE_OWNER_CARD=true` in the installed `.env` and recreate `hermes-proxy`. It defaults to `false` on Linux, Windows, and macOS. Keep direct access limited to a trusted network; enable the gate before publishing Hermes to untrusted users.

ODS Talk still requires its signed session. Dashboard API authentication, owner-card issuance, and invite revocation are unchanged.

Backups retain Hermes configuration and the installation seed in `.env`, but exclude `data/hermes-auth`: its nonsecret policy receipt is regenerated atomically before Hermes starts. After a restore, restart Hermes so that receipt reflects the restored configuration. Missing receipts or receipts for a different seed disable managed login until startup regenerates them; explicit operator authentication remains authoritative.

The dashboard sign-in security update invalidates previously issued ODS session
cookies, including unexpired chat-only guest cookies. Owners renew through their
existing owner card or authenticated dashboard; the reusable owner-card links
remain valid. The current managed launch requires a valid ODS session.

When owner-card gating is explicitly enabled:

- Hermes itself binds **internal-only** (no host port).
- The proxy binds the LAN-facing port (default `9120`) — that's what users browse to.
- Every request to the proxy is verified via `forward_auth` against dashboard-api's `/api/auth/verify-session` endpoint — which HMAC-validates the `ods-session` cookie's signature against `ODS_SESSION_SECRET`.
- Verified (HTTP 200 from the verify endpoint) → traffic is forwarded to `ods-hermes:9119`. Hermes's own [provider session authentication](HERMES.md#security-posture) then handles per-request API and WebSocket access.
- Not verified (HTTP 401 — missing cookie, bad signature, or expired) → 303 redirect to a static "you need an owner card" page.

## Historical original SSO design (before Hermes 0.21.5)

After reading [upstream's web_server.py at our pinned SHA](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/dd0923bb89ed2dd56f82cb63656a1323f6f42e6f/hermes_cli/web_server.py), Hermes's auth is **per-PROCESS, not per-user**. The session token is `secrets.token_urlsafe(32)` generated at server start and baked into the SPA HTML — no env-var to pre-seed, no login flow, no user concept.

Hermes **does** support per-user isolation via [profiles](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/blob/dd0923bb89ed2dd56f82cb63656a1323f6f42e6f/hermes_cli/profiles.py) (separate `HERMES_HOME/profiles/<name>/`), but a profile is bound at process launch — one Hermes process = one profile. There's no in-process profile switching.

This extension does NOT try to give you real multi-user. It gives you:

| Property | Achieved? |
|---|---|
| Magic-link-authed gateway | ✅ |
| Anyone with a valid owner card can reach ODS Talk | ✅ |
| Anyone with a valid advanced Hermes invite can reach Hermes | ✅ |
| A chat-only guest invite reaches Talk or the Hermes gate | ❌ — it sets no `ods-session`; Open WebUI has its own sign-in |
| Anyone without a valid invite gets bounced | ✅ |
| Mom's memories / skills / sessions isolated from Dad's | ❌ — shared |
| The proxy knows WHO is logged in | ❌ — only that *someone* has a valid invite |

If you need per-user isolation, the path is to run **one Hermes container per user** (each with its own profile), and have the proxy route based on the redeemed user's identity. That's [Option B](#future-option-b--per-user-hermes) below — out of scope for v1.

## Enable optional owner-card gating

```bash
# 1. Enable Hermes (the agent itself)
ods enable hermes

# 2. Enable the auth proxy (this extension)
ods enable hermes-proxy

# Set HERMES_REQUIRE_OWNER_CARD=true in the installed .env, then:
ods restart hermes-proxy

# 3. Generate an owner card from the dashboard
#    -> Browse to http://<device>:3001/invites
#    -> Setup / Owner -> Print owner card
#    -> Save the QR / URL

# 4. Recipient scans the QR on their phone
#    -> Lands on auth.<device>.local/magic-link/<token>
#    -> Redemption sets the HMAC-signed ods-session cookie for <device>.local
#    -> 302 redirect to talk.<device>.local/talk

# 5. Recipient browses to http://<device>.local:9120
#    -> Proxy forward_auths to dashboard-api/api/auth/verify-session
#    -> Signature check passes -> forward to Hermes
#    -> Hermes serves the advanced SPA
```

If the recipient has not yet redeemed an owner card or Hermes invite, step 5 lands them on the "you need an owner card" page with instructions. Chat-only guest invites never pass this gate: they land in Open WebUI and set no `ods-session`.

## ODS Talk owner-card flow

Factory owner cards still mint the same signed `ods-session` cookie, but their default landing page is now ODS Talk at `talk.<device>.local/talk`. ODS Talk is a mobile-first local chat portal served by the dashboard container. It talks to Hermes from the server side, so the phone never sees Hermes's internal dashboard token and never gets dashboard admin API control.

Text chat is the primary local flow and works over the normal LAN HTTP path. Spoken replies use the local Kokoro TTS service when enabled. Audio messages can use the phone's native audio picker/capture when the browser offers it. Live browser microphone recording is only shown on secure origins because mobile browsers gate `getUserMedia()` behind HTTPS or equivalent secure contexts.

## What gets verified

The `ods-session` cookie is set by the dashboard-api's magic-link redemption (`routers/magic_link.py`) and signed with HMAC-SHA256 against `ODS_SESSION_SECRET` (see `session_signer.py`). The cookie:

- Is `HttpOnly` (JS can't read it)
- Has `SameSite=Lax` (sent on top-level navigation cross-origin GETs, blocked on background cross-site POSTs)
- Is `Secure` when the redemption host was reached over HTTPS
- Has `Max-Age = 12h` from redemption
- Carries `<random-id>.<expiry-epoch>.<hmac-signature>` — the signature is what gates validity, not presence

On every request the proxy issues a sub-request to `dashboard-api/api/auth/verify-session`, which:

1. Splits the cookie value on `.`
2. Recomputes the HMAC over `<random-id>.<expiry-epoch>` and constant-time-compares it (`hmac.compare_digest`) against the claimed signature
3. Checks the embedded expiry hasn't passed

Any failure (missing cookie, tampered signature, expired timestamp, missing server-side secret) returns a single byte-identical 401 response so an attacker can't probe which step failed.

What this catches:
- Forged cookies (any value not signed with the secret fails the HMAC check)
- Expired cookies (server-side expiry, independent of the browser's `Max-Age`)
- Tampered cookies (changing the `<random-id>` or extending `<expiry-epoch>` invalidates the signature)

What this does NOT do:
- Identify which user is behind a request — the cookie is opaque (the random-id is not a username)
- Track per-cookie revocation. Today's only revocation mechanism is rotating `ODS_SESSION_SECRET`, which invalidates every issued cookie. A future PR could add a revocation list keyed on the random-id; the cookie format reserves space for it.

For the ODS trust model (single home, trusted LAN, family-scale users), this gives real signature-based gating without a session store. The proxy explicitly says "**gating**, not identification."

## Known limitations

1. **No real multi-user.** All authed users share one Hermes — same memories, skills, persona, sessions. Mom can see Dad's chats and vice-versa. Treat Hermes as "the family's agent."

2. **Stolen cookies are valid until expiry or secret rotation.** The cookie is signed, but if it's exfiltrated (malicious browser extension, leaked screenshot, etc.) the attacker can use it until the 12h expiry passes or the operator rotates `ODS_SESSION_SECRET`. There's no per-cookie revocation today. The signed format reserves the random-id field for a future revocation list.

3. **No per-request user identification.** The proxy doesn't add an `X-ODS-User` header to forwarded requests. Hermes can't know "this request is from Alice" — only "this request is from someone with a valid signed cookie."

4. **The cookie's `ods-target-user` field is ignored by the proxy.** Magic-link redemption sets a second cookie naming the target username, but the proxy doesn't surface it to Hermes (there's no Hermes-side hook to consume it).

5. **Direct access to Hermes is now blocked.** Anyone who was reaching Hermes at `:9119` before this extension lands needs to switch to `:9120` (the proxy port). If they want raw direct access for testing, they can `docker exec ods-hermes` or temporarily re-add a `ports:` binding to the Hermes compose.

6. **`ODS_SESSION_SECRET` must be configured.** With no secret set, `verify-session` returns 401 for every request (and `issue()` raises during magic-link redemption) — the proxy gate effectively becomes "nobody passes." Set a 32+-byte random value in `.env` before enabling `hermes-proxy`.

7. **Owner cards are physical keys.** Owner magic links do not auto-expire and are not device-bound in v1. They mint normal 12-hour sessions, but the QR itself remains reusable until revoked from Setup / Owner.

8. **Live mic requires a secure browser origin.** ODS Talk text access works over the LAN-local HTTP flow. Spoken replies and best-effort phone-native audio uploads can work without live mic access, but browser `MediaRecorder` / `getUserMedia()` recording is only offered on secure origins.

## Future: Option B — per-user Hermes

If/when real multi-user becomes a felt need, the path is:

1. dashboard-api dynamically spawns a Hermes container per magic-link `target_username` (each with `HERMES_HOME=/opt/data/profiles/<username>`)
2. The Hermes auth proxy gains a routing layer — reads the `ods-target-user` cookie set during redemption, maps it to the per-user container's address, forwards there.
3. Lifecycle management: idle-timeout to stop unused containers; cold-start when a user returns.

Roughly 2-3 PRs of work and meaningful resource cost (each Hermes container is ~3GB image + ~1GB idle RAM with chromium / playwright loaded). Not worth it until a family member specifically asks for "my own Hermes."

## Disabling the proxy

```bash
ods disable hermes-proxy

# To restore direct Hermes access, re-add a ports binding to
# extensions/services/hermes/compose.yaml:
#   ports:
#     - "${BIND_ADDRESS:-127.0.0.1}:${HERMES_PORT:-9119}:9119"
# (then `ods restart hermes`)
```
