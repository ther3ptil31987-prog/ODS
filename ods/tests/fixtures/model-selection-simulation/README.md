# Model selection before and after the curated-fit selector

`scripts/simulate-model-selection.py` runs `scripts/select-model.py` from an
ODS tree over the 65 hardware envelopes in
`tests/fixtures/model-selection-envelopes.json`, exactly as the Linux and
macOS installers call it. Each pick is then re-checked with the memory
estimator and catalog layouts of the tree the harness runs from, so an older
selector's picks get a real fit column (`corrected GiB`, `fits`, `fits @64K`).

- `before-origin-main-7a328347.md`: the selector and catalog at origin/main
  7a328347 (after #6712), estimated with this change's estimator.
- `after.md`: this change. `tests/fixtures/model-selection-golden.json` pins
  the same picks, and `tests/test-model-selection-matrix.py` checks them.
