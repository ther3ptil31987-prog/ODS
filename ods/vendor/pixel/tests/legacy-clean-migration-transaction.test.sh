# It invokes the actual --migration-commit / --migration-rollback verbs (including the real
# journal parser, custody-directory validation, exclusive custody lock, derived-sibling/
# contract/ownership validation, and the cleanup/finalization state machine) inside a
# completely isolated temporary tree, with fake sudo/systemctl helpers. It never touches
# sudo, systemd, /var/lib, /etc, live Pixel state, private backups, identities, or
# credentials. A crafted journal can never delete or move a sentinel outside the allowed
# contract, rollback restores every pre-state byte and service state, rollback and commit
# are idempotently resumable after a service-restart failure without re-mutating the
# filesystem, a cleanup failure never triggers rollback or destroys the verified new live
# state, concurrent commit-vs-rollback lets exactly one terminal path win, and ordinary 4.3
# restore keeps its strict allowlist.
