"""Read the authenticated root contract (manifest ``paths``) from a decrypted
Pixel private-state backup stream without performing a live restore.

This is a migration-only primitive. Standard restores never use it: they enforce
the strict local 4.2 restore allowlist through audit-private-backup.py. The
clean-migration activate builds its migration contract from the exact roots that
the authenticated 3.2 backup itself declares, so it permits the authenticated 3.2
manifest to omit new 4.2-era control/frontier roots. It does NOT accept a 3.2 root
that 4.2 dropped: the live migration restore still requires every declared legacy
destination to be within the known 4.2 destination allowlist, and standard restore
is never widened.
