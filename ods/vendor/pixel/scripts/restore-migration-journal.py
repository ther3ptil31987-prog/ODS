"""Privileged migration-journal custody helper (runs as root in production via sudo).

This is the single authority for the root-owned mode-0600 migration transaction journal inside
the fixed root-owned mode-0700 custody directory. It is invoked by the non-root restore
orchestrator through ``sudo`` so that the orchestrator can never test availability or write
inside the root-0700 custody. Every operation is descriptor-bound (dirfd + O_NOFOLLOW) and
serialized by an exclusive ``flock`` on the custody directory; it never follows or chowns an
attacker-controlled path and never GNU-installs over a journal. Production requires the root
euid and invokes only fixed absolute trusted binaries (``/usr/bin/systemctl``,
``/usr/bin/rm``, ``/usr/bin/mv``) directly with no sudo wrapper, no PATH lookup, and no
environment override. Every armed/progress/commit/rollback/finalization state transition is a
crash-safe atomic replacement (O_EXCL 0600 temp + fsync + renameat via dirfds + custody-dir
fsync), never an in-place ftruncate that a power loss could leave truncated.

Subcommands (all invoked as root via sudo):
  ensure    CUSTODY
            Create/validate the root-owned mode-0700 custody directory through a bound
            directory descriptor and hold an exclusive flock on it.
  reserve   CUSTODY JOURNAL CONTRACT BACKUP_SHA
            Atomically create the exact journal basename (O_CREAT|O_EXCL|O_NOFOLLOW, mode
            0600) under the custody lock and write an exact reserved state bound to the
            authenticated contract, exact backup SHA256, and the fixed source/target versions
            (SOURCE_PIXEL/TARGET_PIXEL). O_EXCL means EVERY pre-existing marker is refused, including a stale
            reservation for the same contract: there is no implicit stale reclaim in normal
            activation. A per-invocation cryptographic reservation token is generated and
            printed to stdout; arm and abort must present that exact token. Ownership of a
            reservation is therefore bound to the invoking restore process, so a concurrent
            same-contract activation can never reclaim or arm another invocation's reservation.
  arm       CUSTODY JOURNAL TOKEN CONTRACT BACKUP_SHA COUNT DEST... OLD... TEMP... HADOLD...
            UNITS... [SPECFILE]
            Atomically replace the exact reserved marker with the fully armed transaction,
            failing closed unless the exact token, contract, and backup identity match. The
            full transaction is validated with the same exact path/sibling/contract/unit
            validator used by commit and rollback BEFORE anything is recorded. Arm runs
            BEFORE any live destination rename and fails closed unless every hadOld=1
            destination still exists, every hadOld=0 destination is still absent, no oldPath
            pre-exists, and every prepared temporary path is present and a safe top-level
            temp root (a non-symlink directory or a regular single-link file). Records
            per-root old-snapshot evidence captured from each live
            destination while it is still at destination (inode+device+type, which follows
            the content to oldPath if moved) for exact recognition after a sibling rename.
            An optional trailing SPECFILE (an absolute path to a strict JSON document holding
            exactly a deploymentItems array) extends the same armed transaction to also
            protect deployment-state transitions in addition to the private roots: the active
            current symlink, selected single-link regular config/workspace/installed-unit
            files (each present or absent). Each item is a fixed, explicitly validated
            absolute normalized non-root deployment path (rejecting arbitrary/broad/root/
            glob/traversal/symlink-escape inputs) with an exact derived sibling oldPath and
            an exact prepared sibling newPath carrying the target object. Before any mutation
            arm freezes BOTH the live old state (type/owner/mode/device/inode/content-hash/
            target from the live path) and the prepared new object (newEvidence), so install
            detects prepared-new tamper and rollback restores the exact pre-mutation state;
            per-item durable rollback progress and idempotent commit cleanup are shared with
            the private roots under the same exact service quiescence/restart state.
  abort     CUSTODY JOURNAL TOKEN CONTRACT BACKUP_SHA
            Remove only the exact reserved inode if and only if it is still the reserved marker
            for this exact token/contract/backup. Never erases an armed or foreign transaction.
  inspect   CUSTODY JOURNAL
            Read-only validation and truthful JSON summary of the journal/reserved state. No
            state is mutated.
  install   CUSTODY JOURNAL
            Helper-owned idempotent install/swap for every armed deployment item, by bound
            parent dirfd only: move the live old object at path to oldPath when present and
            the prepared new object from newPath to path, fsync after each mutation, and
            persist the durable per-item install/swap state machine before and after every
            step. A crash at any boundary is classifiable and resumable/rollback-safe; the
            next install resumes from the actual filesystem state. This is the ONLY path
            that mutates a journal-managed live deployment path.
  commit    CUSTODY JOURNAL
            Finalize an armed migration swap: mark committed durably BEFORE any destructive
            cleanup and delete the old snapshots. Terminal commit never restarts services
            (they are already running and passed the outer verify) and marks finalization
            complete truthfully without a disruptive restart. Idempotent and resumable; a
            cleanup failure is reported truthfully and never triggers rollback.
  rollback  CUSTODY JOURNAL
            Undo an armed migration swap. The exact validated units are quiesced (stopped and
            verified inactive) BEFORE any filesystem mutation; if any stop or verification
            fails, every validated unit is restarted best-effort and no mutation or rollback
            progress is recorded. Then each root is restored using exact old evidence,
            progress is persisted per root, and services are restarted/finalized idempotently.
