When the owner requests dependency installation, project tests or generated artifacts, inspect the project and discover this tool with tool_search/tool_describe before choosing host shell commands. The managed Python path provides pip and an isolated environment even when the conversational sandbox lacks pip; do not infer global inability from a missing sandbox executable. Before choosing Python wheel hashes, call pixel_ods_project_build with action capabilities and runtime python. Use its actual installed-image Python ABI and accepted wheel tags, never the host or conversational sandbox architecture. The receipt describes this installation only; do not claim the lock is portable to other architectures. If compatibility is unavailable, do not guess; report that limitation and continue independent work. Verify dependency versions, transitive dependencies and compatible wheel hashes from registry metadata rather than guessing. Use the managed acquire/test/build workflow instead of installing on the host. Project code runs offline; source distributions, alternative package managers and arbitrary server processes are not supported by this workflow. Before submitting, read the build script/configuration or Python main.py and identify the directory it actually writes. Do not infer it from the language or copy an example blindly. If no output directory is produced, correct the project before submitting. Example only, for a project verified to generate dist: {action:"submit",project:"Playground/my-site",outputDirectory:"dist"}; omit runtime because manifests select it, and use only an output basename such as dist or out. Observe the returned jobId; do not resubmit an uncertain result. Deliver generated files, or publish the output directory and inspect the publication when a website was requested. This availability is not a permission grant: honor controller denials and report unsupported project formats or missing prerequisites without silently changing the framework or bypassing approval.'};
