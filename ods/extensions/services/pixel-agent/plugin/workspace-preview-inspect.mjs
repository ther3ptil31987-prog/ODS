    description:'Inspect an already published owned snapshot using bounded CSS or exact accessible role/name locators. Pass its exact siteId and sha256 from publication. Each step accepts action and locator. assert-text also requires expectedText: the exact visible innerText after whitespace is collapsed and trimmed, 1 to 256 characters. For counters or status labels, use assert-text before and after clicking (for example 0, click Somar, 1, click Zerar, 0). For a visible editable native text/search/number input or textarea, use fill with value (0 to 256 printable characters), then click and assert the resulting text. Use synthetic test data only, never passwords, credentials or personal/payment data. Password/file/email and other input types, sensitive autocomplete fields, readonly/disabled fields and contenteditable are unsupported. For number fields use finite decimal or exponent strings with a dot separator, or empty to clear; do not use commas, NaN or Infinity. Min/max/step-invalid values are allowed for negative tests: boolean constraint flags report them without declaring the form valid. Fill emits input/change events but does not simulate keystrokes or submit forms. For a visible enabled native single-select, use select-option with value set to one exact option value (empty is allowed), then assert the dependent text. Do not add buttons merely because a test needs to select an option. Custom comboboxes and multiple selects are not supported. To verify delivery bytes use one final download step with path (a snapshot-relative PDF or ZIP), expectedBytes (1 to 4194304) and expectedSha256 (full SHA-256 of that file). The snapshot must already contain exactly those bytes. The download step performs the click itself. Do not precede it with an ordinary click on the download control; use any visibility/text assertions followed directly by download. This captures exactly one download privately inside the capsule; it does not download to the user computer or validate PDF quality or ZIP contents. Blob/data URLs, external URLs and additional downloads are unsupported. Ordinary click steps still cancel downloads; a blocked download is unverified, not a website failure. This runs the real page script in Chromium; do not replace it with a reimplementation in Python or search for Node. A locator is {selector:"#actual-id"} or {role:"button",name:"Exact source name",exact:true}; exact:false is invalid. Immediately after publication, check each requested interaction with an initial state assertion, the relevant click, then an explicit postcondition assertion matching the requested behavior. For downloads, the final download action supplies both the click and byte verification; omit a separate click. Read actual selectors and state changes from the source; do not guess them. Do not wait until finalization. Each locator must match exactly one element. Exact role/name locators match rendered elements; assert-hidden also matches hidden ones, so one role/name can be asserted hidden, clicked into view, then asserted visible. This tests CSS layout visibility, not pixel paint, occlusion or clipping. The result also lists the rendered colors of the page by area at a desktop view as first loaded; use them to confirm a requested color change is actually visible. A click alone proves no behavioral result. Rendered hidden attributes are diagnostic; intentional CSS overrides are not automatically errors. Uncaught page script errors are reported and leave interactions unverified. Unavailable inspection is unverified, never success. No URLs or JavaScript accepted.',
