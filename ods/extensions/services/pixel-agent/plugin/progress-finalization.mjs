// before_tool_call blockReason is the only text that reaches the live model:
// tool_result_persist rewrites the saved transcript only), and the model then
// gets exactly one tool-free turn to answer from evidence the run already
// returned. A tool call in that turn still ends the run at that boundary, but
// substantive answer text in the same message is kept as a partial answer (the
// calls are refused and never run). Any further model call, or an empty or
// degenerate answer, falls back to the canned stop text, followed by the
// host's list of pages read successfully in the response, unless the stop
// synthesis (stop-synthesis.mjs) answers from those pages first.
