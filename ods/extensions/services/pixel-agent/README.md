# Pixel Agent (host ingress)

Dependency-free host ingress that exposes a single **Pixel** gateway to Open
WebUI over a restricted Unix-domain socket. It implements only the host side
of the integration: it owns no container, binds no TCP port, and exists purely
as a hard boundary between Open WebUI and the operator's Pixel gateway.

## Trust model

**Pixel is a single-owner, operator-trusted agent.** This service is the
intentional choke point that decides exactly what reaches the Pixel gateway:

- The gateway token is read **only** from `PIXEL_GATEWAY_TOKEN_FILE` (default
  `/etc/pixel/openclaw.json`), a file that must be owned by the process euid,
  be a regular file (never a symlink), and not be group/world-readable. The
  token is never logged, never written to the status projection, and never
  echoed to any caller.
- **Open WebUI never receives the operator token.** Callers authenticate to
  the socket via the Unix-socket group boundary (`PIXEL_INGRESS_GID`), not via
  a bearer token. The gateway token stays inside the host ingress process.
- No inbound headers are ever forwarded. Inbound `Authorization`, `Cookie`,
  `Forwarded`, `X-Forwarded-*`, and `x-openclaw-*` headers are dropped. The
  upstream request carries only a freshly constructed allowlisted set.

## Surface

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| `GET`  | `/health` | Unauthenticated liveness |
| `POST` | `/v1/chat/completions` | Sanitized, allowlisted forward to the gateway |

Only these two routes exist; everything else returns `404`/`405`. The server
listens **only** on `PIXEL_INGRESS_SOCKET` (default
`/run/ods-pixel/pixel-ingress.sock`) and never listens on TCP.

## Scheduled tasks

Pixel's background `agentTurn` cron jobs (isolated, current, or explicit session)
default to `delivery.mode: none` when
delivery is omitted, so local workspace jobs do not fail trying to announce to
an unconfigured external channel. Explicit delivery settings remain unchanged.
The adapter covers direct and Tool Search calls, with either nested `job` or
flat job fields and an explicit `payload`. Message-only shorthand retains the
upstream default. Other agents and existing jobs are unaffected.

## Security boundaries

- **Extension diagnosis.** `pixel_ods_extensions` exposes read-only catalog
  search, installation-state listing, and configuration inspection. The model
  chooses the operation and order. The tool defaults to `ods-host`, preserves
  an explicit broker target, and returns the actual broker job and result.
  A wait timeout retains the submitted job ID for later readback. It cannot
  install, enable, configure, remove, or approve an extension. Evidence binds
  to the submitted target, query, and extension ID; a terminal failed inspection
  reports that configuration could not be established rather than calling it
  pending or claiming the extension is ready.
- **Unix-domain socket only.** The socket is created at the fixed service path,
  mode `0660`, best-effort `chgrp` to `PIXEL_INGRESS_GID`. If a non-socket path
  already exists at the socket location, the service refuses to start. It only
  ever removes an existing *socket* at its own path.
- **Request hardening.** Request bodies are capped at 2 MiB. Only these fields
  are forwarded (when type-valid): `messages`, `stream`, `temperature`,
  `top_p`, `max_tokens`, `stop`, `tools`, `tool_choice`, `response_format`.
  `model` is forced to `openclaw/default`. Unknown fields are dropped. Invalid
  bodies are rejected with a generic sanitized JSON error.
- **Stable hashed session.** When a caller supplies a string `user`,
  `metadata.chat_id`, or `metadata.conversation_id`, the ingress writes
  `user = "ods-" + sha256(chosen)`. The raw identifier is never passed
  upstream.
- **Upstream is fixed.** By default, read-only health discovery selects IPv6
  or IPv4 loopback on `${PIXEL_GATEWAY_PORT:-18789}`. Requests then go to that
  gateway with
  `Authorization: Bearer <gateway token>`, `Content-Type: application/json`,
  and `Accept` matching the stream mode. Connect/header/body/stream behavior is
  bounded by `AbortController`/timeouts; the total request budget is 32 minutes
  so CPU-only first-turn prefill can finish inside OpenClaw's 30-minute model
  budget and 31-minute stalled-session recovery budget. The fixed loopback hop
  uses Node's core HTTP client instead of the built-in `fetch`, avoiding
  Undici's implicit five-minute response-body idle cutoff; only the explicit
  connect and total budgets can end the request. The non-stream response is
  capped at 2 MiB and each stream line at 1 MiB.
  Upstream bodies are never reflected to the caller; failures produce generic
  errors.
- **Docker Desktop transport (native macOS qualification).** The explicit
  `PIXEL_GATEWAY_TRANSPORT=docker-desktop-host` setting selects only
  `host.docker.internal` on the configured gateway port. The default remains
  `loopback`; arbitrary hosts/URLs are rejected. The transport does not fall
  back to container loopback, follow redirects, or replay failed mutations.
  The ingress still exposes only its restricted Unix socket. This setting is
  one prerequisite, not a complete macOS installer or proof of host isolation.
  Qualification containers mount only the required private token/config file
  read-only, retain the euid ownership check, and receive no Docker socket.
- **Status projection.** On startup and every `PIXEL_STATUS_INTERVAL_MS`
  (default 30000) the service atomically writes a sanitized projection to
  `PIXEL_STATUS_FILE` (default `/run/ods-pixel/ods-status.json`). It reports a
  timestamp, Pixel gateway reachability, ingress readiness, and a **fixed
  allowlist** of ODS service names/statuses obtained by running exactly
  `docker ps --format {{json .}}` via `execFile` with an explicit timeout.
  Container names outside the allowlist, raw command output, environment,
  secrets, image labels, IDs, and mounts are never surfaced. The same fixed,
  argument-only Docker boundary reports the configured llama-server model
  basename and context length. The projection also carries the nonsecret ODS
  version installed by ODS and exact normalized online/deployed-application
  counts; stopped allowlisted containers remain in the deployed total. A
  fixed set of nonsecret `PIXEL_ODS_*_PORT` values mirrors the resolved ODS
  `.env` ports. The gateway validates those values as TCP ports and combines
  them only with an allowlisted application directory to produce localhost
  URLs and purposes; neither arbitrary hosts nor arbitrary paths are accepted.
  If Docker is unavailable, it carries an empty `apps` array, a null runtime,
  and a generic `unavailable` state.
- **Visible post-tool replies.** The plugin adds a Pixel-only system prompt
  contract requiring a visible final response after either projection tool.
  The status remains untrusted evidence and never becomes action authority.
- **Host-authoritative verification truth.** OpenClaw's OpenAI-compatible HTTP
  route does not dispatch channel delivery hooks. Before releasing a completion,
  the private ingress therefore asks the plugin for the exact run's bounded
  verification state over a gateway-authenticated loopback route. Failed or
  still-running verification replaces model-authored success text with an
  honest host-authored result. Streaming responses are bounded and buffered
  until that check completes, so false content is never released and then
  retracted.
- **Protected local host commands.** An explicit owner request to run one
  command on the local ODS host is routed to Pixel Operations as a raw-shell
  proposal, never to sandbox `exec`. One ODS-owned adapter submits the exact
  command and waits internally for the broker receipt, so compact models do
  not need to coordinate a fragile second tool call. ODS enables raw shell only
  on the local `ods-host` target. The broker fixes it to the unprivileged, systemd-confined
  service identity, marks it break-glass/non-idempotent/non-reversible, and
  requires an external owner approval of the immutable plan hash every time.
  Pixel cannot approve its own proposal. The Dashboard independently rechecks
  the job plus plan hash and copies only the host-generated approval command;
  that command requires fresh administrator authentication, displays the
  complete plan, and asks for a one-time challenge before execution. SSH
  targets and the broker-quarantine target continue to reject raw shell.
- **Verified interactive previews.** A website request may use the separate
  `pixel-workspace-preview.service` to snapshot bounded static files from the
  Pixel workspace onto `127.0.0.1:${PIXEL_PREVIEW_PORT:-9437}`. The service
  takes no arbitrary host path or destination, follows no links, executes
  nothing, never overwrites a snapshot, and reads back `index.html` before its
  receipt is accepted. Only that exact receipt can produce the structured SSE
  marker that opens the Dashboard's sandboxed side panel; model-authored URLs
  remain ordinary text. ODS supplies no creative artifact bytes: open-ended
  showcases, games, task boards, animated SVGs, voxel scenes, and every other
  visual request use the same model-authored workspace-file path. The preview
  adapter can publish only an existing directory containing `index.html`; it
  has no template, scaffold, HTML, title, theme, or content input.
  Published `.json` assets must parse as UTF-8 JSON without duplicate keys or
  nonstandard numeric constants. Validation uses the captured bytes and never
  rewrites them. Rejections report the artifact-relative filename and decoder
  line/column when available, without quoting its contents. Intentionally
  malformed examples can be displayed as `.txt`; required JSON exports must be
  repaired. Syntax validation does not establish application semantics or that
  exported source matches executed source; those checks remain necessary.

## Configuration (nonsecret)

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `PIXEL_INGRESS_SOCKET` | `/run/ods-pixel/pixel-ingress.sock` | Unix socket path (UDS only) |
| `PIXEL_INGRESS_GID` | unset | Numeric GID allowed to connect to the socket |
| `PIXEL_GATEWAY_TOKEN_FILE` | `/etc/pixel/openclaw.json` | Restricted owner-private OpenClaw config containing the gateway token |
| `PIXEL_GATEWAY_PORT` | `18789` | Validated fresh-install loopback gateway port; override when another trusted local Pixel owns the default, then retain that value on reinstall |
| `PIXEL_STATUS_FILE` | `/run/ods-pixel/ods-status.json` | Status projection path |
| `PIXEL_STATUS_INTERVAL_MS` | `30000` | Status write interval |
| `PIXEL_ODS_VERSION` | `unknown` | Nonsecret ODS version exposed in the bounded status projection |
| `PIXEL_ODS_*_PORT` | ODS service default | Installer-generated, validated user-facing port mirror (for example `PIXEL_ODS_N8N_PORT` and `PIXEL_ODS_WHISPER_PORT`) |

Secrets are never configured here. The token lives only in
`PIXEL_GATEWAY_TOKEN_FILE`.

## systemd unit

`host/pixel-ingress.service` runs as the same unprivileged owner as the Pixel
gateway and is hardened with `NoNewPrivileges`, `ProtectSystem=strict`, `ProtectHome=true`,
`PrivateTmp`, `PrivateDevices`, `RestrictAddressFamilies=AF_UNIX AF_INET
AF_INET6`, an explicit read-only bind for the gateway token file, and a `UMask=0007`.
It creates `/run/ods-pixel` (`RuntimeDirectory` mode `0710`) and restarts on
failure. It contains no credential.

The separate Operations Broker remains unprivileged with an empty capability
set. Its ODS drop-in uses a closed device cgroup allowlist for only the NVIDIA
compute nodes needed by the fixed, read-only GPU observer; disks, input
devices, cameras, and microphones stay unavailable. On WSL, `AF_VSOCK` is
available only so the fixed Tailscale observer can try root-owned interop
sockets and return installed/running state. The policy exposes no model-chosen
PowerShell command or parameter. The general Tailscale observer never projects
addresses, peers, accounts, routes, device identifiers, or arbitrary PowerShell
output. A separate `host.network-peer` action may return only the private
addresses, ICMP result, and bounded TCP-port results for one owner-named peer;
it rejects ranges, URLs, public and loopback addresses, authentication, remote
commands, and mutation.

## Rollback

This ingress and the isolated preview origin are additive host services.
Removing them restores the previous
state: Open WebUI simply cannot reach the Pixel gateway, and the default agent
surface falls back to the ODS-managed agent lanes (**Hermes**, or **OpenCode**
for coding). The preview listener is loopback-only; uninstall removes it and
only its recursively revalidated content-addressed snapshots. The ingress
itself still has no TCP listener or persistent state beyond the runtime socket
and status file in `/run/ods-pixel`.

## Development

The implementation is importable and does **not** start a server when imported;
it only starts when run as the main module. Run the test suite with:

```bash
node --test ods/extensions/services/pixel-agent/tests/*.test.mjs
```

Requires Node 20+ and uses built-ins only (no npm dependencies).
