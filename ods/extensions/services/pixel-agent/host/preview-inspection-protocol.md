# Snapshot-bound preview inspection protocol

`pixel_ods_workspace_preview_inspect` is optional. Registration and completion
requirements must be enabled only when the protected inspector is installed.
Publishing remains static, create-only byte publication; it gains no Docker
socket or browser authority.

## Request

The plugin sends one JSON object with `schemaVersion: 1`, `action: "inspect"`,
`siteId`, the full snapshot `sha256`, `viewport: {width, height}`, and `steps`.
Each step has `action` (`assert-visible`, `assert-hidden`, `assert-text`,
`select-option`, or `click`) and
`locator`. A locator is either `{selector: "CSS"}` or
`{role: "button", name: "Show items", exact: true}`. Semantic roles are
allowlisted. There are no URLs, executable expressions, shell commands, image
names, host paths, or Docker arguments in this protocol.

Requests are limited to 8 KiB, 12 steps, viewport dimensions 240–1920 pixels,
256 Unicode characters / 1024 UTF-8 bytes per CSS selector, and 120 characters /
480 bytes per accessible name. Controls and formatting controls are rejected.
Every locator must match exactly one element, including hidden assertions.

## Locator matching

A CSS locator matches through the isolated world's `querySelectorAll`, hidden
elements included. An exact role/name locator for `assert-visible` or `click`
matches only rendered elements: Chromium's accessibility tree, united by
element identity with Playwright's default
`getByRole(role, {name, exact: true})` role and name rules in the isolated
world. Chromium's names apply CSS `text-transform` (an uppercase-styled
"Show sold out" button is "SHOW SOLD OUT" there); Playwright's names, which the
capsule's own click and the owner's checks use, are the source text. Either
name matches. The rendered-only rules leave out every element hidden for ARIA
(Playwright's `isElementHiddenForAria`: `display: none` or
`aria-hidden="true"` on the element or an ancestor across shadow hosts, an
unslotted shadow-host child, or the element's own `visibility` or
`content-visibility`; opacity does not matter, as in the accessibility tree)
and hidden descendants from a name. Uniqueness counts the union.

That tree omits hidden elements and computes no name for them, so for
`assert-hidden` an exact role/name locator also matches hidden elements. The
same role/name can therefore be asserted hidden, clicked into view, and asserted
visible. The hidden-inclusive match follows Playwright's
`getByRole(role, {name, exact: true, includeHidden: true})` role and accessible
name rules; script, style, template, and noscript text never contributes.
Names compare after whitespace is collapsed, case-sensitively. It runs in the
isolated world. Chromium's rendered matches are kept and the union is
de-duplicated by element identity, so a rendered element is matched exactly as
for the other actions, and uniqueness counts rendered and hidden matches
together.

A step whose locator matches no element fails as `no_match` with
`before: {count: 0}`. A step whose locator matches several elements fails as
`selector_not_unique` with that count. Capsules built before `no_match` report
zero matches as `selector_not_unique`, and callers accept both. Neither is
evidence about visibility: the caller must correct the locator and retry on the
same snapshot, not change the site to satisfy a locator.

## Evidence scope

The receipt binds the exact site, full snapshot hash, viewport, and canonical
UTF-8 JSON request hash (`planSha256`). Each executed step records its index,
locator, CSS visibility measurement, stable sampling, status, and (for clicks)
after measurement. Remaining steps are not executed after a failed assertion.
A click dispatch alone proves no resulting behavior. Verify the requested
initial state, click, and resulting condition with separate assertions.

A Chromium CSS parser `SyntaxError` produces an `invalid_selector` failed step
bound to the exact submitted locator and index. That step has `stable: false`
and no `before` or `after` measurement: invalid syntax does not establish a
missing or hidden element. Earlier steps remain in the receipt and later steps
are not executed. The caller must correct the CSS or use a supported exact
role/name locator while retaining the requested interaction checks. Selectors
are never translated or relaxed. Other browser failures remain unavailable.

Visibility means CSS layout visibility, including opacity and ancestor CSS
visibility. It does not prove pixel paint, clipping, occlusion, or a full
accessibility audit. Exact role/name locators do check that accessible match.
Measurements run in an isolated Chromium world so page script cannot replace
the measurement APIs. Visible elements bearing `hidden` produce a diagnostic;
they fail only an explicit hidden assertion. Intentional CSS overrides are not
rewritten or rejected at publication.

Stable sampling requires two identical observations 100 ms apart. If they
disagree, sampling continues for at most 1.5 seconds per observation, allowing
ordinary finite transitions to finish. Persistent disagreement fails as
`unstable`; timeout never substitutes for a visibility verdict. The page's
animations and styles are never paused, sought, or changed. This is sampled
stability, not proof of continuous visibility between or after observations.
The overall 45-second capsule deadline remains unchanged.

## Page script errors

The capsule records uncaught exceptions raised by the inspected page (the
Playwright `pageerror` event on the inspection page, registered before
navigation) from startup until the receipt is built. The fixed wrapper document
contains no script, so page script exceptions come only from the sandboxed
preview frame or a frame it created. The listener is page-scoped; blocked
popups are never observed. Console messages are not recorded: they are
author-controlled logging, and blocked resources already appear in
`blockedRequests`.

Browser automation also injects URL-less scripts into every document.
Playwright's service-worker block reads `navigator.serviceWorker`, which throws
a `SecurityError` in every opaque-origin preview frame. An exception whose
entire stack lies in URL-less anonymous code is therefore not attributed to the
page. Page code always runs from its document or script URL, and the CSP
forbids string evaluation; a top-level page exception with no stack frames is
attributed. The service-worker block itself is unchanged.

When at least one exception was observed, the receipt carries
`pageErrors: {count, messages}`. `count` is 1–1000 and saturates at 1000.
`messages` holds one to three distinct messages in first-seen order, each
`name: message`. Control, format, private-use, surrogate, unassigned, and line
or paragraph separator code points become spaces; whitespace is collapsed; a
message longer than 200 characters is cut to 199 plus `…`. The field is absent
when nothing was observed and in receipts from capsules built before it existed.
Callers validate these exact bounds and reject any other shape.

Message text is author-controlled data. Callers present it only as quoted,
untrusted page output and never follow it. Page errors change neither step
status nor receipt `status`, and never block publication. A receipt carrying
`pageErrors` is not verified interaction evidence: callers report the
interactions as unverified and direct a script repair, republication, and a
fresh inspection. An author handler that cancels the error event (for example
`window.onerror` returning `true`) suppresses the report, so absence is not
proof that no script failed.

The capsule is baked into the locally built inspection image. A host keeps
producing receipts without `pageErrors` until the installer rebuilds that image.

## Rendered colors

Local models are often not multimodal, and CSS source alone does not show what
is painted: an accent variable used only by `:focus` outlines changes nothing
visible. Publication is byte-only and renders nothing, so the capsule reports
the painted palette with every receipt it builds.

After the step context is closed and its receipt is final, the capsule loads
the same snapshot once more in a separate context of the same browser: a fixed
1280x720 desktop viewport, default (light) color scheme, device scale 0.25.
It uses the same loopback server, request guard, navigation limit, and popup,
download and websocket blocking, and registers no page-error listener. It
waits 100 ms after `load`, takes a 320x180 PNG screenshot of the viewport (one
device pixel per 4x4 CSS pixels) and decodes it with the standard library. The
page as first loaded is captured, never the state left by the inspected
clicks, and never hover or focus styles.

Each pixel's exact color goes to one fixed bucket. A color with chroma under
26/255 is neutral and named by HSL lightness: `black` (<0.13), `dark gray`
(<0.40), `gray` (<0.72), `light gray` (<0.94) or `white`. Otherwise the HSL hue
names the family: `red` (<12 or >=345 degrees), `orange` (<36), `amber` (<50),
`yellow` (<68), `green` (<165), `teal` (<195), `blue` (<255), `purple` (<290),
`pink` (<345). Red with lightness >=0.75 is `pink`; hues 12-50 that are dark
(lightness <0.35) or muted (saturation <0.5 and lightness <0.7) are `brown`.
Chromatic buckets split into three lightness bands (<0.35, <0.65, rest).

The receipt carries `renderedColors: {viewport: {width, height}, colors}`.
`colors` lists at most six buckets by pixel count, largest first; ties order
by bucket name and band. Each entry is `{name, hex, percent}`: `hex` is the
most frequent exact color in the bucket (lowercase `#rrggbb`, ties to the
lowest), and `percent` is the bucket's share of the viewport rounded half up.
Buckets rounding below 1% are not listed, so the rounded shares can exceed
100 by at most one half per entry. Callers validate these exact bounds and
reject any other shape.

The palette is evidence about paint only. It never changes a step or the
receipt status, and it does not prove any requested behavior. A failed or
blocked capture omits the field, as do receipts from capsules built before it.
The tool states it once, in a fixed line after the assertion scope, and omits
it from the quoted evidence copy:

`Rendered colors (by area, desktop 1280x720 as loaded): white 77%, green
#2d5a3d 12%, green #4a7c59 7%, light gray 3%, gray 1%. Colors under 1% of the
view and hover/focus-only styles are not listed.`

Neutral names carry no hex. The line is part of the inspection tool result
only, never the system prompt. The capture adds about 0.2 seconds to an
inspection. A host keeps producing receipts without `renderedColors` until the
installer rebuilds the inspection image.

## Load-time control names

An owner may require a control "named exactly X", and the accessible name is
what assistive technology and exact role/name locators use, not the visible
text. A page script can replace a correct name on load (fleet round 100:
`setAttribute('aria-label', ...)` on the requested button), which neither the
published bytes nor a CSS-selector plan reveals.

After the 100 ms settle that follows `load`, and before any step runs, the
capsule evaluates one read-only function in the isolated world. It walks the
document (and open shadow roots) with the same Playwright-compatible role and
name rules as the hidden-inclusive matcher and records every element whose
role is `button` or `link`, hidden ones included, in document order: its role,
its computed accessible name, whether it is exposed (in the accessibility tree
and rendered with a box; opacity, which entrance animations change at load, is
ignored), what supplied the name (`aria-labelledby`, `aria-label`, `content`,
or `other` such as `title`, `value` or a `<label>`), and its own content text
when that differs from the name. A control in the accessibility tree is named
as Chromium and the fleet's default `getByRole(role, {name, exact: true})` name
it: descendants the tree leaves out (Playwright's hidden-for-ARIA rules:
`display: none`, a non-visible `visibility`, `content-visibility`,
`aria-hidden="true"` on the element or an ancestor) contribute nothing, so an
`aria-hidden` icon or chevron, a hidden alternate label or a `display: none`
badge is no part of the name, unless it is reached through an
`aria-labelledby`, `<label>` or SVG `<title>` reference that is itself hidden.
A control that is itself hidden keeps the hidden-inclusive name that
`getByRole(..., {includeHidden: true})` matches. The own text follows the same
rule. Names and text are author-controlled: whitespace is collapsed, control,
format, private-use, surrogate, unassigned and line or paragraph separator code
points become spaces, and each is cut to 120 characters (119 plus `…`).

The receipt carries `controls: {count, items}`. `count` is the page's total
number of such elements (saturating at 1000); `items` lists at most the first
48, and stops earlier when the encoded items would exceed 6 KiB, so `count`
larger than the list length means the list is incomplete. Each item is exactly
`{role, name, visible, source}` plus `text` when present. The field is absent
when capture fails and in receipts from capsules built before it; it is also
dropped rather than let a receipt reach the 32 KiB output limit. Callers
validate these exact bounds and reject any other shape.

The names are evidence about names only. They never change a step or the
receipt status and are not interaction evidence. The tool omits them from its
quoted evidence copy; when an exact role/name locator matched nothing and a
control of that role shows the locator's name as its text (or differs only in
letter case), the locator feedback states the actual name and what supplied it.
The plugin checks owner-requested control names against them (see
`COMPLETION-RELIABILITY.md`). A host keeps producing receipts without
`controls` until the installer rebuilds the inspection image.

## Host custody and isolation

Linux/WSL uses `/run/ods-pixel-inspection/control.sock`, a root-controlled 0750
parent with a 0660 group-connectable socket. The kernel peer UID must match the
configured owner. Group write permission on the parent is forbidden: it would
allow replacing the socket and forging receipts. The broker can use the
minimum read capability to traverse the owner's protected immutable snapshots.

Native macOS invokes the fixed protected helper via `/usr/bin/python3`.
Configuration is root-owned, not group/other writable, at
`/etc/ods-pixel-inspection.json` (Linux) or
`/usr/local/libexec/ods-pixel-services/helpers/preview-inspection.json` (Mac).
Exact fields: `imageId`, `docker`, `snapshotRoot`, `ownerUid`, `transport`.
The image is an installed immutable `sha256:` ID; the Docker executable is a
fixed platform allowlist entry and root-owned. The Docker endpoint is explicitly
pinned to `/var/run/docker.sock` or the configured Mac owner's Docker Desktop
socket, never ambient Docker context/environment.

CLI: `serve` accepts authenticated local requests; `request` runs the fixed
native helper request; `health` verifies the installed image identity without
executing a site; `export` reads only `/previews` in the publisher container.
Native export uses fixed `docker exec` argv and actual container UID ownership.
Export grants the publisher no Docker authority. Snapshots are reopened with
the publisher's stable no-symlink file checks and rehashed, then rehashed again
inside the capsule. File count/size caps remain 128 / 4 MiB each / 16 MiB total.
No archive extraction is used.

Every browser run is a fresh Docker capsule: `--pull=never`, `--network=none`,
read-only root, UID/GID 65534, all capabilities dropped, no-new-privileges,
1 CPU, 1 GiB memory, 128 PIDs, private 128 MiB shared memory, and a bounded
256 MiB temporary filesystem. No host mounts, sockets, credentials, or host
URLs enter it. The only stdin is the validated plan and base64 immutable file
map. The loopback server reproduces production iframe sandbox, CSP, MIME/UTF-8,
and CORS/security headers. Foreign requests, extra navigation, popups, and
downloads are blocked; service workers are disabled.

The runner permits at most 45 seconds and 32 KiB output. Cancellation and
termination unwind through exact randomly named container removal. `docker run`
termination alone is not treated as container cleanup. Missing engine, image,
browser, invalid snapshot, or invalid receipt is explicit failed/unverified.
There is no host-browser fallback.

## Tests

Native `select-option` adds exactly one `value` string to the step: the exact
option value, at most 256 Unicode characters / 1024 UTF-8 bytes, with no control
characters. Empty values are allowed. The locator must uniquely identify a
visible enabled native single-select containing one enabled matching option.
Multiple selects, custom comboboxes and controls with over 1000 options are
unsupported. Disabled fieldsets and option groups remain disabled. Chromium's
normal selection operation dispatches input/change; isolated-world observations
bind the native selected value and option state before and after. A successful
selection alone does not prove dependent application behavior: assert the
resulting visible text in a subsequent step. Do not redesign the page merely
to accommodate the inspector.

Selection plans use the scope suffix `Native single-select values were observed
only for explicit select-option steps.` Existing plans and scope remain
unchanged. The installer requires the capsule label
`org.osmantic.ods.inspection.select=native-single-select-v1`; before any selection
plan the broker checks the configured immutable image for that capability.
An older capsule returns a bound `unsupported_capability` failure without
executing the plan. Update the plugin, broker/export helper and capsule together;
mixed older installations remain unverified, with no host-browser fallback.

Downloads remain canceled. `blockedRequests: ["download"]` is explicitly an
inspector policy limitation, not proof of a website defect or of handler
completion. Keep the publication unchanged and report the download unverified;
do not retry the same blocked operation. No download bytes or destinations are
accepted by this protocol.

`test_preview_select.py` and `inspection_select.test.mjs` cover exact bounded
values, selection receipts, unsupported old images, disabled/ambiguous controls,
normal input/change events, hostile author prototypes and unchanged download
blocking. The Python suite uses the same opt-in Chromium/Docker settings below.

`node --test tests/test-preview-inspection.mjs` checks plugin contracts,
Unicode hash compatibility, forged/incomplete receipts, unavailable results,
page-error bounds and presentation, rendered-color bounds and the fixed
line, and load-time control-name bounds and locator feedback.
`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p test_preview_inspection.py` checks
protocol, ownership, paths, immutable bytes, subprocess bounds, cleanup,
page-error receipt shaping through a scripted browser double, the PNG decoder
and palette buckets, the separate palette capture, and control-name capture
order, sanitization and bounds.
Set `ODS_PREVIEW_BROWSER_TESTS=1` only for the fixture Chromium suite; it also
checks the hidden-inclusive and rendered-only role/name matchers against
Playwright's own `includeHidden` and default `getByRole` engines, and replays
the fleet round 069 page (`tests/fixtures/preview-palette/tower1-r069`) and its
amber repair, the fleet round 100 page
(`tests/fixtures/preview-controls/tower2-r100`), its repair, four variants of
the repaired page whose button carries hidden decorations, and four small pages
for load-time control names, and a page of hidden-descendant,
`aria-labelledby`, `<label>`, SVG `<title>` and hidden-control cases. Each
reported name is checked per element against Playwright's own name: the default
`getByRole` engine for a control in the accessibility tree, `includeHidden` for
a hidden one. It also replays two laptop pages whose uppercase-styled
"Show sold out" buttons Chromium named "SHOW SOLD OUT"
(`tests/fixtures/preview-inspection-laptop-round101.html`,
`tests/fixtures/preview-inspection-laptop-round107-site-1f5f2cf8.html`), and
counts the matchers' style and label reads to keep their work linear. Set
`ODS_INSPECTION_TEST_IMAGE=sha256:<candidate>` for real isolated-container
smoke, observed hidden-flex regression, hung-script, and cancellation cleanup.
These test-only variables never select a production image or grant authority.

## Native text and number input

`fill` takes exactly `action`, `locator`, and `value`: 0–256 printable Unicode
characters, up to 1024 UTF-8 bytes, within the existing 8192-byte request cap.
Use only synthetic test data. One visible, enabled, editable native
`input[type=text]`, `input[type=search]`, `input[type=number]`, or `textarea` is supported. Password,
file and other input types, contenteditable, disabled/readonly fields and
credential/payment autocomplete metadata are refused. Known sensitive field
names are also refused; this is not a claim of universal semantic PII detection.
The isolated page has no user autofill profile, host files or external network.

The native setter runs in Chromium's isolated world and emits `input` and
`change`. This does not simulate keyboard events, trusted typing, focus/blur or
form submission. Follow it with the real page control click and explicit
postcondition assertions. Do not rewrite an interface to accommodate a test.
Existing value content is never included in observations; receipts bind the
requested value and booleans for eligibility/editability/exact value match.
A fill pass proves only the bounded fill operation, not the whole form.

Numbers use a finite decimal or exponent string with a dot separator, such as
`100`, `0`, `.5`, or `-1.25e2`. An empty string clears the field and permits
required-field tests. NaN, infinity (including overflow), commas, whitespace,
hex and incomplete numeric syntax are refused **before** the setter runs with
`numeric_value_required`. No coercion or locale conversion silently changes the
requested value. Exact readback still determines whether the fill passed.

Synthetic values that violate `min`, `max`, `step` or `required` are intentionally
allowed: they are necessary to test the actual page's validation. Numeric
observations add an exact `numeric` object with boolean `syntaxValid`,
`valueMissing`, `rangeUnderflow`, `rangeOverflow`, `stepMismatch` and `badInput`.
These flags neither expose the old value nor claim the form is valid. Use the
page's actual button and assert its visible calculated result or error. CSS
locators work for number fields; no additional accessible roles are introduced.

The immutable capsule must advertise
`org.osmantic.ods.inspection.fill=native-text-number-fill-v2`. The broker checks this
before snapshot reads or execution; mixed old images fail closed with
`unsupported_capability`. Deploy protocol, broker, plugin and rebuilt capsule
together. No network, navigation, file or download permissions are added.
`test_preview_inspection_fill.py` exercises real Chromium form handlers,
selection after filling, typed refusals, old-image rejection and blocked
network effects; `inspection_fill.test.mjs` rejects forged fill receipts.
