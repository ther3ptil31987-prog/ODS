# Open WebUI — ODS branding

How ODS brands the Open WebUI chat surface that users see daily.

## What's branded today

Set via env vars in `docker-compose.base.yml`. These flow into Open WebUI's runtime config and surface in the page title, PWA install dialog, and share links.

| Variable | Default | What it controls |
|---|---|---|
| `WEBUI_NAME` | `ODS` | The display name. Appears as the browser tab title, the header inside the chat UI, and — critically — the label next to the ODS icon when the user adds the chat to their phone's home screen. |
| `WEBUI_URL` | empty | Optional public URL Open WebUI uses for share links, OAuth callbacks, and PWA install metadata. Leave empty for traditional localhost usage. Headless/proxy installs should set it to `http://chat.${ODS_DEVICE_NAME}.local` after ods-proxy + mDNS are enabled; tunnels should use their public URL. |
| `ODS_DEVICE_NAME` | `ods` | The mDNS hostname segment. Drives `${...}.local` and is reused by future remote-access integrations. |

ODS passes `WEBUI_NAME=ODS` to the pinned Open WebUI v0.11.4 image. That
version's [name handling](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/blob/v0.11.4/backend/open_webui/env.py#L951-L953)
appends ` (Open WebUI)` to a custom name, so the expected default is
`ODS (Open WebUI)`. Verify the actual page and PWA on the installed version;
this setting does not promise that all upstream branding disappears.

## License boundary

The pinned [Open WebUI license](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui/blob/v0.11.4/LICENSE)
contains a branding restriction and specific exceptions: deployments or
distributions with no more than 50 end users within a rolling 30-day period,
specific prior written permission from the copyright holder, or a duly executed
enterprise license. ODS does not grant an exception. Retain upstream branding
unless the applicable exception or written permission has been established.
This is especially relevant when redistributing an appliance or making a
service available to others.

## What's not branded yet (follow-up work)

Open WebUI's PWA manifest pulls its name from `WEBUI_NAME` (✓) but its icons and theme color from static assets bundled inside the container image. A future branding change must first establish permission under the pinned
upstream license and record that evidence in its PR. Only if permitted, the
technical work could include:

1. **Override `/static/favicon.png`, `/static/splash.png`, `/static/logo.png`** — Open WebUI serves these from `/app/backend/static/`. Mounting a ODS-branded set via a volume mount in the compose service is the cleanest path:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./extensions/services/open-webui/branding/favicon.png:/app/backend/static/favicon.png:ro
     - ./extensions/services/open-webui/branding/logo.png:/app/backend/static/logo.png:ro
     - ./extensions/services/open-webui/branding/splash.png:/app/backend/static/splash.png:ro
   ```
2. **Source actual icon assets.** Sizes needed:
   - `favicon.ico` — 16x16, 32x32, 48x48 (multi-resolution)
   - `apple-touch-icon.png` — 180x180
   - `pwa-192.png` — 192x192 (Android home screen)
   - `pwa-512.png` — 512x512 (PWA splash + larger displays)
   - `pwa-maskable-512.png` — 512x512 with safe-zone padding for adaptive icons
   - `splash.png` — 1024x1024 brand splash for iOS PWA launch
3. **Set `theme_color`** to a ODS brand color (currently Open WebUI defaults to its own dark gray). This may require a custom `manifest.json` override served via the same volume-mount approach if Open WebUI doesn't expose a theme-color env var.

## Where future assets should live

```
extensions/services/open-webui/
├── BRANDING.md       (this file)
├── manifest.yaml
└── branding/         (new — added when icon assets are produced)
    ├── favicon.ico
    ├── favicon.png
    ├── apple-touch-icon.png
    ├── pwa-192.png
    ├── pwa-512.png
    ├── pwa-maskable-512.png
    └── splash.png
```

Asset production needs design input (ODS logo, brand palette) before this directory should be populated. Placeholder assets risk shipping in a release if not caught.

## Testing the current PR

After this PR merges, on a running ODS:

1. Browse to the reachable chat URL: `http://localhost:3000` for traditional local usage, or `http://chat.ods.local` after enabling ods-proxy + mDNS.
2. The default custom browser-tab name should retain the upstream suffix: `ODS (Open WebUI)`.
3. On a phone, after adding the page to the home screen, verify the installed PWA label and retained upstream attribution.
4. Inside the chat UI, verify the displayed name and retained upstream attribution.

Keep the upstream icons unless a reviewed, permitted branding change replaces them.
