# n8n

Workflow automation platform for ODS

## Overview

n8n is a visual workflow automation platform that connects ODS's AI capabilities to external services and APIs. It runs at `http://localhost:5678` and is pre-integrated with llama-server for LLM-powered automations. The ODS dashboard can install and manage curated workflow templates directly into n8n.

## Features

- **Visual workflow editor**: Drag-and-drop node-based automation builder
- **400+ integrations**: HTTP requests, webhooks, databases, cloud services, messaging apps
- **LLM tool use**: Connect local LLM (llama-server) as an AI agent within workflows
- **Dashboard integration**: Install pre-built workflows from the ODS workflow catalog
- **Webhook triggers**: Expose local automations as HTTP endpoints
- **Scheduled runs**: Cron-based workflow scheduling
- **Persistent storage**: Workflow definitions and execution history in `data/n8n/`

## Configuration

Environment variables (set in `.env`):

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `N8N_USER` | `admin@ods.local` | Email of the n8n owner account ODS creates (see **Cannot log in**) |
| `N8N_PASS` | *(generated)* | Password of that account; n8n resets the owner to it at every start |
| `N8N_PORT` | `5678` | External port (maps to internal 5678) |
| `N8N_AUTH` | `true` | Deprecated: n8n v2.x has built-in user management |
| `N8N_HOST` | `localhost` | Hostname used in generated URLs |
| `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` | `http://localhost:5678` | Public webhook base URL; use the HTTPS ingress URL for remote access |
| `N8N_SECURE_COOKIE` | `auto` | Uses a non-`Secure` session cookie only for loopback HTTP; keeps `Secure` for HTTPS and network binds |
| `N8N_PROXY_HOPS` | `0` | Number of trusted reverse proxies in front of n8n |
| `TIMEZONE` | `UTC` | Timezone for scheduled workflows |

`N8N_SECURE_COOKIE=auto` lets Safari use a local, loopback-only ODS
without weakening remote sessions. An explicit `true` or `false` overrides the
automatic policy. Do not set it to `false` when n8n is reachable from another
machine.

## API

n8n exposes its own REST API at `/api/v1/`. The ODS Dashboard API uses this to manage workflows programmatically.

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/healthz` | Health check |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/workflows` | List all workflows |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/workflows` | Create/import a workflow |
| `PATCH` | `/api/v1/workflows/{id}` | Update a workflow (e.g. activate) |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/workflows/{id}` | Delete a workflow |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/executions` | List execution history |

## Dashboard Workflow Catalog

The ODS dashboard provides a curated catalog of workflow templates at `/api/workflows`. Templates are stored in `config/n8n/` as JSON files and can be installed with one click from the Workflows page.

```bash
# Check available workflows via dashboard API
curl http://localhost:3002/api/workflows

# Install a workflow
curl -X POST http://localhost:3002/api/workflows/my-workflow-id/enable
```

## Data Persistence

| Path (host) | Mounted at (container) | Contents |
|-------------|------------------------|----------|
| `data/n8n/` | `/tmp/.n8n` | Workflows, credentials, execution history (persistent bind mount) |
| `config/n8n/` | `/tmp/workflows` | Pre-built workflow templates |

## LLM Integration

To connect n8n to the local LLM, add an HTTP Request node pointing to llama-server:

- **URL**: `http://llama-server:8080/v1/chat/completions`
- **Method**: POST
- **Auth**: None (internal network)

Or use LiteLLM as a unified gateway (requires `LITELLM_KEY`):

- **URL**: `http://litellm:4000/v1/chat/completions`
- **Header**: `Authorization: Bearer YOUR_LITELLM_KEY`

## Files

- `compose.yaml` — Service definition
- `manifest.yaml` — Service metadata and feature definitions

## Troubleshooting

**Service not starting:**
```bash
docker compose ps n8n
docker compose logs n8n
```

**Cannot log in:**
- New installs, and installs where nobody had created n8n's owner yet, get
  the owner account from `.env`: sign in with `N8N_USER` and `N8N_PASS`.
  ODS sets it before n8n starts, so there is no first-run screen to claim.
  n8n resets this account to those values at every start and does not let
  you change them in n8n; to change the password, change `N8N_PASS` in
  `.env` and restart n8n.
- If someone created the owner on n8n's first-run screen before ODS
  managed it, that account and its password stay as they are.
- If you have lost that password, run
  `docker exec -it ods-n8n n8n user-management:reset` (it removes the
  other users; workflows and credentials move to the owner), then restart
  n8n. ODS then sets the owner from `.env`.

**Going back after an n8n upgrade:**
- n8n's database upgrades cannot be undone. Before a new n8n version first
  starts, ODS copies the database to `data/n8n/ods-backups/` and keeps the
  two newest copies. To go back, stop n8n, restore a copy as
  `data/n8n/database.sqlite`, and pin the previous image.

**Webhooks not receiving external traffic:**
- Put n8n behind an HTTPS reverse proxy and set `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` to its public URL (e.g. `https://n8n.example.com`)
- Set `N8N_PROXY_HOPS` to the number of trusted proxies and ensure the proxy forwards the standard `X-Forwarded-*` headers

**Secure-cookie warning in the browser:**
- Restart or recreate n8n after upgrading so the automatic cookie policy is applied
- Loopback HTTP (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1`) automatically uses a local-compatible cookie
- Remote access must use HTTPS; keep `N8N_SECURE_COOKIE=true` and set `N8N_WEBHOOK_URL` to the public HTTPS URL
- Behind one reverse proxy, set `N8N_PROXY_HOPS=1` and forward `X-Forwarded-For`, `X-Forwarded-Host`, and `X-Forwarded-Proto`

**Workflow import failing via dashboard:**
- Confirm n8n is healthy: `curl http://localhost:5678/healthz`
- Check dashboard-api logs: `docker compose logs dashboard-api`

**File permission errors on startup:**
- n8n runs as `UID:GID` set in `.env` (default `1000:1000`)
- Native macOS installs set `N8N_RUN_USER=node` because the image home directory is not accessible to the macOS host UID. Other platforms retain `ODS_UID:ODS_GID`; `N8N_RUN_USER` can explicitly override it.
- Ensure `data/n8n/` is owned by that user: `chown -R 1000:1000 ods/data/n8n`
