"""The shared compose policy is one rule set, run by both extension validators.

dashboard-api (routers/extensions.py:_scan_compose_content) decides at install
and enable time; scripts/resolve-compose-stack.sh (_scan_user_compose_content)
decides on every `ods` command. The resolver is a self-contained Bash script
(tests and installers copy it alone), so the policy is a delimited block kept
byte-identical in both files instead of an import. The rule fixtures live in
test_accelerator_policy_fixtures.py; this file guards the sharing itself and
ODS's own compose files.
