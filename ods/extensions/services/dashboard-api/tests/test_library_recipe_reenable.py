"""Enabling an installed curated library recipe reuses install's trust decision.

Install grants a curated recipe its local ``build:`` and the host-gateway
``extra_hosts`` route after staging it from the library. Disabling and then
enabling it, or starting it after a stop, must reach the same decision from
the same evidence: the installed files still match the library recipe. An
imported recipe, or a curated one whose files changed after install, must
still get the untrusted checks.

The recipes are the real curated mapshaper (local build) and ollama (image
only) recipes, and gateway-app (local build + host-gateway), which this test
builds from mapshaper's files and the parts the removed GAIA recipe added.
Each is installed through the real library install path into a temporary
root.
